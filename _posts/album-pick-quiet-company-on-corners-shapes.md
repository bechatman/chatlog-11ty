<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Quiet Company" data-album="Red Right Hand" data-caption="'Red Right Hand,' the albums's lead-off single may be the most recognizable to long-time fans on an EP that pushes the boundaries of Quiet Company's sound."></div>

Quiet Company has the distinction of being the band that has changed the most of any band I've listened to while keeping a fairly consistent sound. From the Christian Rock hangover of \*Shine Honesty\* to their breakup with god on \*We Are All Where We Belong,\* The band had a distinct perspective of writing love songs that tackled big topics â€” specifically losing your faith in a religious family and getting married and raising a child in the midst of that.

While these albums were definitely personal, 2015's \*Transgressor\* felt intimate as the entire album dealt with the strain a rising music career puts on a family. Though it should have been obvious on first listen, it turned out to be the soundtrack to lead singer Taylor Muse's marriage ending (and, ironically, the soundtrack to dating my soon-to-be wife and our wedding ... go figure). 

\*Transgressor\* was the band's biggest play for mainstream success, and I can only judge the results of that effort and Taylor's subsequent divorce by what came next. 

The band released two EPs in 2017 and had planned a third that seemed to evaporate. The tone started nearer that of transgressor on the first EP, but the lyrical topics drifted into darker places as the second EP dealt with a person on the rebound acting on instinct while not necessarily comfortable with where his life had gone. \*On Corners & Shapes\* was the missing culmination of these albums and delivered the sonic departure that these darker themes needed.

While lead single "Red Right Hand" has the distinct Quiet Company sound, this EP was intended to be Taylor's solo project before being brought back into Quiet Company canon. Each track has a very different texture that takes you from pleading at the end of his relationship through recklessness and near nihilism before achieving some kind of closure.

Fans of Quiet Company will still recognize their sound here, but this is not the radio friendly entry point into a band on the rise. This, as the two other EPs before it, are songs for fans willing to hear a songwriter give voice to a difficult time in a sometimes uncomfortably raw way. 

It is an unintentional microcosm of Rock music today: Intensely personal music that doesn't strive to be commercially viable, likely doesn't allow its members to quit their dayjobs, but delivers an emotional gut punch that only the best art can.
