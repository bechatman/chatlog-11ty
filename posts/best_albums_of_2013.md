This past year, I have become obsessed with achieving perspective.

Though I didn’t see “Midnight in Paris” until Dec. 30, it’s core theme was my mantra for the year: The greatness and the “Golden Ages” of the past only look like that with time, and focusing on those eras distracts from the amazing things happening in the present.

With my newfound perspective achieved (insert sarcasm punctuation here), I have a feeling that I’ll look back on 2013 as one of the greatest years in music, but that also makes picking a top albums list very difficult. All of the following 13 albums are probably equally amazing, so this listing is just a snapshot of my thoughts at this moment. Here’s hoping 2014 can shake up my worldview even more.

## Honorable Mentions

- Neko Case, “The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You”
- Sebadoh, “Defend Yourself”
- Off With Their Heads, “Home”

## Top 10

### 10. Laura Stevenson & The Cans, “Wheel”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Laura Stevenson" data-album="Wheel"></div>

Laura Stevenson hit South by Southwest the right way: A few songs mixed and out the door as an EP; and a new album set for release just a few weeks after hitting Austin. It took three mentions on NPR for me to pick up the album, but its blend of folk singer-songwriter style and shades of punk rock just keep me coming back to it.

### 9. Minor Alps, “Get There”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Minor Alps" data-album="Get There"></div>

This collaboration between Juliana Hatfield and Nada Surf’s Matthew Caws has more fingerprints of the latter than the former, but the result is an amazing album. It has Caws’ usual witty (and neurotic) lyrics with great hooks combined with harmonies that set it apart from standard Nada fare. The only downside: Overreliance on programmed drums.

### 8. Superchunk, “I Hate Music”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Superchunk" data-album="I Hate Music"></div>

“I Hate Music” shows that Superchunk has found a way to let lyrics mature with the members while keeping the music youthful and exuberant — and they did it while dealing with death. Through memories of a lost friend and coping with their own mortality, they still managed to deliver an album that you want to sing at the top of your lungs with the windows down.

### 7. Toad the Wet Sprocket, “New Constellation”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Toad The Wet Sprocket" data-album="New Constellation"></div>

Toad may be yet another band to make an attempt at a comeback more than a decade after disbanding, but their wildly successful Kickstarter campaign and the fan response to the actual album (released to backers a couple weeks after the campaign started) shows that this was the album all of their fans were waiting for.

### 6. Frank Turner, “Tape Deck Heart”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Frank Turner" data-album="Tape Deck Heart"></div>

Frank Turner’s “Tape Deck Heart” delivers a bigger sound — thanks to the greater involvement of backing band the Sleeping Souls — that provides a great counterpoint to honest, introspective lyrics. It takes a few listens for many Turner fans to adjust, but the album more than stands on its own.

### 5. Queens of the Stone Age, “Like Clockwork...”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Queens of the Stone Age" data-album="Like Clockwork..."></div>

I’ve always been hot and cold on QOSTA. Sometimes their music just hits the spot, but other times it seems almost unlistenable. “Like Clockwork...” changed that. The album is perfect from end to end, and it embodies the “swagger” critics always attributed to the band in the past (a description I didn’t get until now).

### 4. The Virgins, “Strike Gently”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="The Virgins" data-album="Strike Gently"></div>

This is the only 2013 album that has never dropped off the iPod (or whatever I happen to be carrying). Imagine what would happen if Ric Ocasek, Elvis Costello and Tom Petty made an album, and that’s The Virgins. Much like Cartman singing “Come Sail Away,” if I start the album, I have to listen all the way through.

### 3. Midlake, “Antiphon”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Midlake" data-album="Antiphon"></div>

Sometimes evolution just leaps forward. I loved the past two Midlake albums, but the bearded forest hermit schtick was getting old fast — then their main songwriter, Tim Smith, left the band. Moving up from his backup vocals/guitar position to the lead, Eric Pulido managed to salvage the band and take it farther sonically. “Antiphon” is the perfect marriage of the psychedelic and ambient influences of early Midlake, the folk sounds that made them popular and a new propulsive

### 2. Mount Moriah, “Miracle Temple”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Mount Moriah" data-album="Miracle Temple"></div>

This album — which ostensibly deals with sexual politics in the god-fearing South — led to a fairly serious musical identity crisis for me. Though lumped in the indie rock category, this album is clearly Country, and I am supposed to hate Country. I’m not saying this album erased on of my prejudice and hatred for the genre, but it definitely expanded my horizons.

### 1. Portugal. The Man, “Evil Friends”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Portugal. The Man" data-album="Evil Friends"></div>

I almost wrote off my favorite album of the year because of the involvement of Danger Mouse. After getting past my initial “Broken Bells Part 2” impression, I saw that this album brings all of the best elements of Portugal to the surface: The great hooks, the funk/hip hop-fueled rhythms and the big themes that come from the psychedelic tradition. I went a couple months playing it every time I got in the car, and removed it from my music player to try and not over play it. I don’t think I’ve gone a whole week without listening to at least one song on it, though.
