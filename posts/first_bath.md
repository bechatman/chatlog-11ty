Brian and I were the perfect team. We were loving partners, best friends, and devoted parents. We did everything together, not only in our relationship, but for Jonas as well. Brian came to all my doctor’s appointments when I was pregnant, and we always went to all of Jonas’ pediatrician appointments together. We tag-teamed middle-of-the-night diaper changes and feedings – when Jonas got up, we both got up.

And we always gave Jonas a bath together, every night.

Our bath time routine would look like this: I would get the bath water ready, lay out a fresh diaper, towel, and pajamas. Brian would do the bathing. I would hand Brian the washcloth or the Fuzzy’s cup when he needed them (Yes – to this day, we use Fuzzy’s cups as our bath time water pourer). We would both chime in and sing various songs to Jonas as he was in the bath. “Splish splash, I was taking a bath….” would usually always come up.

The first time I ever gave Jonas a bath alone was probably just before Jonas turned one. Brian’s new job demanded long hours, many times running into dinner and bath time. Reality started to hit that we wouldn’t always be able to do bath time or other things together, just due to timing.

My first time giving Jonas a bath all by myself felt so overwhelming. I felt like a brand-new parent again, with a new baby just back home from the hospital. I thought, “We can do this.” And, we did. I was actually quite proud of myself, and afterwards went into Brian’s study and proudly said, “I just bathed Jonas all by myself.” He was proud of me too. :)

After making it through that first time, I would bathe Jonas a few more times by myself, on nights when Brian was working late.

I honestly can’t remember bathing Jonas the week after Brian died. It was before the funeral, and we were still in Jacksonville. I must have, but I also think my mom and Brian’s mom may have given him his bath every night. Those days are both a blur and extremely vivid at the same time.

But what I do remember was that first bath once we arrived in Texas for Brian’s funeral.

One of the scariest and most stressful moments after Brian died was giving Jonas a bath. This was an activity that Brian and I had always done together, minus those few late work nights. I thought, “I can’t do this. How am I supposed to bathe Jonas by myself? For the rest of my life. Forever.”

I realize that Jonas will one day be able to bathe himself, but in the moment, it felt like something I’d be facing for the rest of my life. It was symbolic, really, of what I was about to go through, doing everything alone for the rest of my life without Brian. I would have to parent and raise Jonas by myself for the rest of my life. It was utterly terrifying and devastating. I felt like I could barely function.

“I can’t even bathe my own child,” I thought. “How am I going to get through this? How can I be a single parent? I can’t do this.”

Brian’s mom helped me bathe Jonas that night. That first bath, having just arrived back in Texas, was literally one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. I felt helpless and so alone.

The next day was the day before Brian’s funeral. Numerous family members were over that night to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah, more people than usual since they were in town for Brian’s funeral. It felt nice and comforting to be around family, yet I felt isolated at the same time.

After everyone arrived, I remember being in the bathroom alone with Jonas. I can’t remember what I was doing, maybe I was brushing his teeth. It was time to start getting him ready for his bath and put him to bed. The comfort of being around family began to wane as I could hear chatter and laughter out in the living room. Being alone with Jonas in the bathroom made me feel so far away – alone in this new world of sorrow, grief, pain, and fear.

I suddenly felt completely broken again without anyone to help me. In that moment, I said out loud, “I can’t believe I have to f*ing do this alone”. And just as the words escaped my mouth, my sister-in-law, Kelly, appeared in the doorway of the bathroom and said “Sarah, do you need any help with Jonas?”

As much as I was embarrassed that I had said such a word in front of my infant son, I was so grateful for Kelly. I was grateful that her and my brother were there that night, not just for Brian’s funeral, but to spend Hanukkah dinner with us. I was grateful for her appearing in that exact moment – a moment where I felt I was crumbling into a thousand pieces. She was there for me that night and the next, to help me during the hardest days of my life. She helped me bathe Jonas that night and put him to bed. It made me feel just a little less alone, and less afraid.

Bath and bedtime would continue to be a struggle for me during the weeks ahead. Bath time was filled with anxiety, and I would struggle to get through a bedtime story without breaking down crying, reading through my tears. But as time went on, as family and friends took turns staying with us and helping us, we established routines, and we pushed through.

Tonight, as I gave Jonas his bath, I thought back to that first bath after Brian died. I thought about how far we’ve come. Bath time is now a happy time in our house. I actually look forward to it, to seeing Jonas’ excitement.

I get the bath ready, lay out a clean towel, diaper, and pajamas. But, instead of Brian standing there with me, I have Jonas beside me, bouncing up and down with excitement as he watches the bath fill with water. I love watching his amazement by the water pouring from the Fuzzy’s cup as he tries to catch it with his hands and seeing his pure joy as he splashes his legs and arms wildly in the water. We play games with his bath toys, stacking cups and wearing them on our heads like hats. We point to and name the different sea animals on his bathmat.

Bath time is no longer filled with fear and sorrow, but instead filled with the pure joy of a toddler wondering how water magically pours from a facet, or relishing the waves made by splashing his arms and legs in the tub.

We’re in this happier place now because of the family and friends that helped us along the way, appearing in the doorway during my weakest moments to help give me strength when I had none. Every night during bath time, we experience joy and laughter, and we know Daddy is singing along with us, “Splish splash, I was taking a bath…bum-bum bum-bum...".
