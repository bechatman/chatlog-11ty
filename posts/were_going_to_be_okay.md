  This weekend I got to experience what it felt like to be happy again. There

  for a while. But this weekend gave me hope that more days of happiness will be

Saturday was Brian’s birthday and also Pi Day. As such, we celebrated in classic Brian style – with pizza pie. Jonas and I went to our favorite spot in Jacksonville that Brian and I had discovered since moving here: the Beaches Town Center at Atlantic and Neptune Beach. We had only ever gone there twice as a family, but it had already become “our” place – that place where you can escape to on the weekends and find so much joy and relaxation from visiting.



Brian loved the area because it was a spot where everyone was out and about, walking the streets, eating at restaurants, and just enjoying life. It’s a very cute, walkable area with restaurants, shops, and beach access. Brian didn’t care so much for the beach itself, but he did walk out each time to see the waves, get pictures, and then after about two minutes say, “Okay, that’s enough. Let’s go get coffee.” And that’s what we would do.



Brian, Jonas, and I would go each lunch, enjoy the outdoors and people watch, walk to the beach, and then walk down the street to get coffee. This would have been our Sunday routine for the foreseeable future, more than likely.



So, on Brian’s birthday that’s what we did – Jonas and I celebrated as if Brian were still here with us. We first ate lunch at a new (for us) pizza place. The weather was perfect, just amazingly gorgeous, so we sat outside at a table along the sidewalk where people would pass us by on their bicycles, perhaps on their way to the beach or to the shops. It wasn’t too hot, it wasn’t humid, there were no bugs, and there was plenty of shade at our table – making it a Brian-approved day to sit outside. He would have loved it.



Then we went next door to get custard – Brian’s favorite. Jonas ate some custard too but made funny little faces and stuck out his tongue, as the custard was a bit too cold for him. We then walked along the path to the beach, right up to the sand at the entrance, peeked over the dunes to see just the top of the ocean, and admired the waves. After about a minute – that was enough – we left to go get coffee…just as Brian would’ve done.



I ordered a medium roast French press (Brian’s usual order at this particular coffee shop), and Jonas and I sat outside in the patio courtyard. It was so peaceful. We were shaded by a large umbrella, and I slowly sipped my coffee, enjoying the serenity of the afternoon. People at neighboring tables were quietly enjoying their beverages, or just reading a book. Jonas ate a snack and played with all sorts of items in his stroller.



Pizza, custard, coffee – in our spot – was the perfect way to celebrate Brian on this day. He would have enjoyed it immensely.



In fact, nothing could have made this day any better…except for what happened next.



As Jonas and I were leaving the coffee shop patio, I was blissfully happy. I was thinking about Brian and just remembering him, reflecting on his life and our memories together…and out of nowhere, I heard guitar music. I turned around and a young woman and man had appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. They were walking along the sidewalk behind me and Jonas, one playing a ukulele and the other an acoustic guitar. They were playing a beautiful melody, similar to what Brian would play when he was just messing around on his guitar or ukulele for me and Jonas.



They continued playing behind us as we walked for another block. I smiled and laughed to myself as they played, and then suddenly, the music stopped. I turned around, and all of a sudden, they were gone. They had appeared and serenaded me in the very moment I was thinking of and remembering Brian, and then they were gone.



And I thought – that was Brian. It was like Brian had sent them to me to let me know that he was okay, to let me know that he’s still with me – always walking beside me on every path, as I walk seemingly alone.



It was a magical moment; one I can’t explain. It brought me to tears and filled me with joy – and that’s when I thought, “we’re going to be okay.”



I’ve always known Jonas and I were going to be okay. I know I can provide for Jonas, and we have amazing help from family and friends; but everything has seemed so unbearable at times. In the worst of those moments, I always wondered how we would get through – how \*I\* would get through, emotionally. But, instead of knowing or simply telling myself that we were going to be okay, in that moment, I actually felt it for the first time since losing Brian.



This weekend I got to experience what it felt like to be happy again. There will still be hard days, of course – probably most days will be hard, at least for a while. But that day gave me hope that more days of happiness will be sprinkled into the mix.



Brian reminded me this weekend that he will always with be us. We take him wherever we go, walking beside us, strumming a beautiful melody as we walk down our path. He will always be there to remind us, that we’re going to be okay.
