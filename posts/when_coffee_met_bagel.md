It was five years ago that a single Brian and a single Sarah each tapped on their smartphone screen – a tap that would change their lives forever.



At the time we didn’t know it, but we had been circling each other’s orbit for years – years of missed connections that finally became new friendships and fun stories we would tell our mutual friends about how they failed to get us together sooner. (Thanks a lot Ben and Chrissy!!! Talk to your neighbors more!! ;) )



And after all of that, a single touch was all it took to connect us to each other.



It all started with a dating app – Coffee Meets Bagel. At the time, this was a newer app and was different from many of the other dating sites. Instead of scanning profiles for hours on end, the app would send you one “bagel” every day at noon. If both people hit “like”, then a text message window would appear, and you had seven days to talk back and forth before either meeting in person/exchanging phone numbers or choosing to go your separate ways. If you did not have a mutual “like”, then you waited until the next day, to receive your next “bagel”.



On the day Brian and I both hit “like”, we both had been in the same place, emotionally – a place of discouragement but still trying to put ourselves out there. We would later discover we had each been on this site before and had both just recently reactivated our accounts. Both of us had been inspired to try again.



Personally, I didn’t think I would meet anyone I liked. I thought I would continue to put myself out there, but maybe I’d meet someone after I graduated and moved away for my post-doc. Brian had even toyed with the idea of moving away to a new city– a fresh start to find someone.



Isn’t that when you find the love of your life – when you reach a point of giving up?



But then one Wednesday afternoon, Brian was my “bagel”, and I was his – we both clicked “like”. He seemed nice and good looking. Actually, he even looked a little familiar. “I think I’ve seen this guy’s profile on Match in the past. I skipped over it,” I said to myself. I went back to my Match profile, and sure enough, I had once looked at Brian’s profile and decided not to like it. I didn’t understand some reference he made to vinyls, and I decided to move on. This would later show up in Brian’s vows to me on our wedding day, teasing me that I had once passed him by - but from my perspective, it just wasn’t our time to meet yet.



I still remember our ice breaker question the app auto-generates. “What’s your favorite holiday treat?” I remember our answers. Mine was lefse – a Norwegian flatbread. Less than 2 years later, there will be video of Brian making lefse with my family at Christmas. Meanwhile, Brian’s answer was Buckeyes – a peanut butter-fudge treat beloved in Ohio (treats Brian came to know thanks to the same Ben and Chrissy). I remember only general aspects of our conversation over those first several days before finally meeting in person.



Fast forward five years later, and I’m talking with a friend. “You know you can email customer support and request a copy of your chat transcript?”, she said. My heart skipped a beat.



A few days ago, I requested my chat transcript with Brian from Coffee Meets Bagel customer support. They immediately replied and sent me a .csv file with the data – sender, recipient, date and time, and the message.



Getting to your read your first “conversations” with your husband is like getting to go back in time – transported to an alternate you, an alternate him. Although not quite alternate, just versions who are younger and lacking the knowledge of the future, of the life you would make with each other and of the love you would share.



As I smiled and laughed and teared up reading our messages, something caught my eye. “Are you kidding me? This is beyond coincidence!”



Sure enough, five-years-ago Brian and Sarah had something in common with today – pandemics! Five years ago, on our second day of talking, Brian made a joke about me one day investigating a pandemic. This is classic Brian. He just always knew everything.



Some of the messages were bittersweet. Brian made comments about what he would be doing 10-15 years from now for work. Those words are incredibly sad to read now, knowing those 10-15 years and those goals would never happen.



Our conversation over the next few days were filled with various questions as we started getting to know each other. We covered the basics – TV shows and school/work. Not surprisingly, it gets nerdy really quick – heh, we’re both nerds. It ended with Brian making a roundabout way of asking me out for coffee. I said yes.



We met on a Tuesday – for coffee, after work. Our first moments laying eyes on one another would be recounted back to our respective best friends that night. We both knew. We both felt it. This was different. If this is the one, this is what it would feel like. And we were right.



There was something magical in each of our smiles. I described Brian’s smile as “radiating with kindness.” He would describe me as, “the only person I’ve ever met to just relieve stress on sight.” (He was running late from work). It was instant.



We went inside to order. Brian ordered a mocha. I ordered a latte. We sat at the first table just outside. It was a new and strange feeling. There were no nerves. No feelings like we needed to try to impress each other. It just felt natural. It was fun and relaxing. We would both describe that it felt like finally meeting a best friend that you didn’t realize you already had and just hadn’t met yet.



I was particularly impressed that Brian came prepared. He mentioned that he came across a *New York Times* article titled, “[The 36 Questions that Lead to Love](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/style/36-questions-that-lead-to-love.html)”. It’s an article containing a set of questions that were “scientifically proven” to create emotional intimacy, laying the foundation for a relationship, and to potentially fall in love. The people behind these questions were actually researchers, and they were trying to find out what made dates successful in creating intimacy. Brian asked me if I was interested in taking turns answering some of the questions - I said yes. This sounded way more fun than, “How many siblings do you have? Where did you go to school?”



As Brian and I made our way through the questions, I just remember having so much fun. I didn’t want the date to end. I felt like I already had a new best friend, after just one meeting.



(Man, perhaps those researchers deserve a Nobel Prize or something!)



If you’re reading this story, you know what happens next. Brian and I fell in love. We became each other’s best friend, partner, companion, lover, confidant, and most trusted advisor.



We had an incredible and healthy relationship. We could talk to each other about anything. Before Brian and I met, we both had actually read the same article, “[Science Says Lasting Relationships Come Down to 2 Traits](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/happily-ever-after/372573/)”, describing research to determine what traits contribute to healthy, happy marriages. The two traits described in the article were kindness and generosity. I attribute these two traits to the success of our relationship. I’ve always described Brian as a “gentle, kind spirit.”



Brian’s first date plan consisted of more than just asking each other questions. He had already committed to only staying at our date for one hour, no matter how things were going. If they were going well, he would ask me out for a second “real date” on the spot. He did. I excitedly said yes.



In the past, Brian and I had always been worried about those awkward moments you may have with someone new. Brian even made a joke along the lines of, “Watch, we’re going to say goodbye and then end up walking the same way.”



And sure enough, that’s exactly what we did.
