It was the first strategy I wanted to build a deck around. And it was awful.

As a seventh grader in 1996 who just got hooked on [cardboard crack](http://cardboard-crack.com/post/46319563600/color-wheel) in the form of an intro pack a couple weeks before, I didn't really understand which cards were good ... or that you needed multiple copies of good cards if you actually wanted to draw them on a regular basis (probability probably wasn't covered in school yet). I had to trade away some cards I wanted to keep, but I was convinced that one copy of [Leviathan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=26619) was key to dominating the cafeteria table.

The process of building a deck and tweaking it became a ritual. Choosing the cards that would go with my new acquisition, buying single cards at the hobby shop, getting booster packs in hopes of lucking into a card I couldn't afford, eventually realizing the mistake in using Leviathan and crafting a new deck built around vampires. 

Magic the Gathering became my life — for about six months.

## Regeneration

Though my brief obsession with Magic the Gathering looked like other short-lived trends — Pogs, Fleer's 1995 X-Men trading card run, that stupid lanyard making/trading thing — you might say that those initial matches in middle school ignited a spark, that took me to other planes before bringing back to the game 20 years later.

Even having played in the past, Magic's physical history of thousands of cards since I stopped playing and many rule changes presented a potentially steep learning curve.

My on-ramp back into the game was the now defunct Duel Decks — a set of two themed decks designed to play against each other. Being able to buy a product and play with a friend is great, and the rules guide included helped get me back up to speed. Still, when none of your friends play, showing up with decks and explaining the rules doesn't make for exciting game play.

There was only one solution: Buy a bunch of cards, put together a better deck, and go to a game store.

## Banding

Magic is a game that requires community to be played, and local game store events are the best place (or only place) to get in some competitive play and learn from people who know how things are done.  

While turnout is not strong at every store, many game stores have a tight-knit group of regulars that show up week in and week out. There are usually at least a few people who will give new people pointers, but showing up with a deck built from random cards is a receipe for demoralizing losses.

Why? Card pool — all of the cards that are legal to play and to which you have access.

Remember, Magic has thousands of cards, and not all are created equal. Magic's parent company Wizards of the Coast prints fewer copies of the cards deemed to be the most powerful. When you open a booster pack of 15 cards, 10 will be from a list of common cards, four will be uncommons, and one will be a rare. There is also a mythic rarity that replaces a pack's rare in around one in every eight packs.

By buying a bunch of packs, I was walking in with a ton of common cards, a few uncommons and even fewer rares. The people I was up against, in addition to being far more experienced in selecting cards to include in a deck, have either traded or bought individual cards to make decks with the maximum four copies of the best rares and uncommons. I played four rounds of best-of-three matches, and I didn't win one round. I did force a couple game threes, but that was it.

What I did take away was some good advice from more experienced players. Which cards would improve my deck. Which cards should probably be replaced. I also learned that in-store events are not for everyone.

Wizards of the Coast loves to push Friday Night Magic. Every week, players can bank on a game being played at a local game store. These games, however, are in a tournament format and will end up eating at least two to three hours of your evening. With more people, it could go longer. If I were single, it would have been great, but abandoning your wife every Friday to play Magic is generally frowned upon.

## Dark Bargain

There is no way to improve in Magic without paying to play. How much depends on who you are playing with and how you are playing.

Limiting the card pool is the best way to keep the cost down and level the playing field. To do this, Wizards of the Coast created formats for game play that limit cards that can be used by set and through a list of banned or restricted cards. Formats that limit themselves to cards currently in print will have lower prices due to a growing supply; formats that allow cards not currently in print will see the prices of the most desirable cards go up through third-party singles sellers as supply is increasingly restrained. 

The most straightforward way to level the playing field is the __Limited__ format. Limited has players open fresh packs of cards and build decks on the spot (usually with an hour time limit on building the decks). The cost is predictable because you know the price of buying three to six packs. The rarity system ensures that the number of powerful cards available to everyone is low. Limited also helps build up a collection of cards, though you likely will have more chaff than wheat. 

Want to use some of those cards from Limited or singles you bought online? The most common way is the __Standard__ format.

Standard allows cards from the latest two years of sets (not including a bunch of speciality sets) with a year's worth of sets rotating out every October to make way for the next year of cards. The wider set of cards makes for some very interesting decks, but two factors make this potentially expensive: The Magic Pro Tour and the Internet. 

With professionals "solving" for the most effective decks to earn prize money, and a medium that allows lists of those cards to be disseminated widely, most of the decks you will see are pulled straight from the pros. That drives up the prices for cards in those decks, making competitive decks cost $200 or more. 

But what happens when those cards rotate out of Standard? 

Card values drop when Standard rotates, unless the card becomes desirable in other formats like __Modern__ — a format that doesn't rotate and allows cards dating back to the mid-2000s. If you have been playing Standard for a while, you probably have the cards to play in Modern. New players, however, are looking at price tags of $500 to $1,000 or more to play in that format thanks to individual cards worth $50 to $100 that you need four copies of to make some decks work.

In Standard, Modern and many other formats, there are budget options. Some of those decks can even make an impact at your local game store, but the more competitive the store, the less likely it is that you can use a budget deck and see some success. 

That is perhaps the biggest problem I have with returning to Magic: People who might get into the game are getting priced out. Buying all the pieces of a pro-level deck at once is far more money than anyone other than the truly obsessed would spend. Where this problem becomes even bigger, though, is with kids.

There's always a 12-year-old there to beat me at a game store event, but two or three middle and high schoolers are vastly outnumbered by adults. It would be one thing if we played in bars with our expensive decks, but making game stores into an adult space drives away many of the kids. Likewise, too many kids in a store will drive away adults and their salaries. 

## Command Beacon

While the official formats occupy most of the conversation around Magic, players are constantly trying to create their own formats that iron out perceived issues. Sometimes, though, these formats make their way to the mainstream.

__Commander__ is both an entirely new way to look at Magic and optimized to make the game more like the games you used to play as a kid. 

Most Magic is played one-on-one. You sit down with another player for a best-of-three match where you use decks tuned to kill the other player as quickly as possible. In some cases, you may not talk to the other player except to say what your play is. Cards that can be played to great effect early in the game are valued above all others, which is why many Modern games don't last past turn three or four. Commander, on the other hand, is primarily a multi-player format geared at making a single game as dramatic and lengthy as possible. 

Where I was mistaken about the value of getting one card for my deck back in seventh grade, Commander is a format where one card makes a difference. Only one copy of each card is allowed instead of the usual four. Players have double the life to start the game. Decks are massive, with 100 cards instead of the standard 60 in other pre-constructed formats. Most importantly, though, decks are often designed around themes, with players including their favorite cards — something seventh-grade me would do instinctively. 

More players and more life means more time to build up complex strategies. Only one copy of the best cards means that cards that have no place in other formats become playable or even game winning. That single copy of a Leviathan has a place in a Commander deck if it fits your deck's theme and strategy.

The biggest boon to the format, though, is that Wizards of the Coast started releasing pre-constructed Commander decks in 2013 and including cards in their more recent sets that are really only good in multiplayer formats. This changed everything.

Unlike Standard or Modern, you can walk into a store, buy a Commander deck and play with experienced players in their format and have a legitimate chance at being competitive. This is so effective in getting new players interested in the game and activating lapsed players that [the concept is now being brought to Standard](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/challenger-decks-lists-2018-02-23).

I didn't get the real value of the format, though, until I started working for a company where several co-workers already were playing Magic. Commander is the perfect format for our group because those who don't want to constantly buy new cards can keep bringing the deck they paid for once, but those like me who like to brew up new decks have a place to try out their creations. 

The format also revives another practice: Buying booster packs. As in all formats outside of Limited, buying singles is the right way to get cards for any deck, but there is just something fun about visiting a store and buying a couple packs to see what you get. It is a bit like buying a lottery ticket, but you are far more likely to get one copy of something that goes into a commander deck or makes you think of a new deck to build.

## Alpha Brawl

If Commander has a downside, however, it is that building a 100-card deck from 25 years of possible cards takes quite a bit of time. Even though having one copy of each card keeps costs down, too many expensive cards can make Commander decks as expensive as Standard decks (and, more rarely, Modern decks) even if they are nowhere near as dominant over budget decks as expensive decks in other formats. 

Several variations of Commander with smaller decks and other limitations have come and gone, but a new one just hit the scene from an unusual source: Wizards of the Coast. 

Rather than letting the grassroots build up support for a format before wading in, Wizards brought the __Brawl__ format directly to the community alongside a [Standard-legal set that supports it well](http://articles.edhrec.com/lets-brawl-dominaria-legendary-review/). It is a singleton format like Commander, but the deck is only 60 cards from Standard-legal sets. While the threat of Standard rotation is off-putting to many players, though, this is a major selling point for me.

While rotation can be frustrating when you have invested in a deck, Brawl's similarities to Commander create a very clear path for new players to enter the game and for old players to try new things. A player can easily play in a few Limited events over the course of a year, buy a few singles, build a 60-card Brawl deck and play. If that deck is still fun by the time rotation hits, the player can add more lands and find another 20-30 cards from older sets to convert the Brawl deck into a Commander deck. Over time, a single here or there may replace those original cards, but they could come from past sets or new sets. The deck grows and evolves with the player.

In theory, this is the way that regular Magic should go — Limited to Standard to Modern — but that progression is biased toward players that have been playing for a long time. Modern simply requires cards from older sets, and new cards rarely replace format staples in top-tier decks. Commander certainly has format staples from older sets that cost some money, but running a newer card with a similar effect will yield similar results. Decks have an impact based on how consistently they can get any card with the effect they need, rather than needing a specific card to make a strategy work.

## Archetype of Finality

In the three years since I came back to Magic I have seen the game rise to its greatest heights and endure rising criticism for its makers' decisions in recent sets. Still, with the announcement of the Brawl format, it seems Wizard is confirming some of my core beliefs about the game.

Magic is a trading card game, and any developments that emphasize that core pillar are welcome. While Limited, Standard and Modern are weighted to players who value the strategy and competitive aspects of the game above all else, Commander and Brawl have balanced the scales to emphasize collecting and community.

Those two aspects are what drew me to the game in 1996. They are what kept me interested in the game after having moved 800 miles away from my regular play group. They are what make me value physical cards over just playing Magic's online games.

Magic has something for everyone willing to dedicate some time (and probably a little money) to it. For a game with so many rules, you have to appreciate that it somehow still manages to be a blank canvas for players' creativity.
