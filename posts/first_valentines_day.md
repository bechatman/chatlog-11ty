I never thought the week of Valentine’s Day would be harder for me than any other day after losing Brian. After all, Valentine’s Day is just a holiday created to sell cards, chocolates, and flowers. We didn’t even celebrate Valentine’s Day anyway. (Well, we always said that…but in the end, Brian would usually surprise me with flowers or chocolates or something sweet and loving. I guess we did celebrate it in our own way.)



So, here’s how my Valentine’s Day week went: Jonas and I both started it off sick with a cold. It could have been the flu; I’m not sure. It left me in bed for most of the day, barely able to move. Luckily, Jonas had recovered and was back in daycare.



While sick, I had to sit at the Tax Collector’s office to remove Brian’s name from our car title. On my way home, I had to stop by the grocery store, where I was greeted by a holiday display of about 50 or so red “I love you” balloons, hundreds of flowers and boxes of chocolates. It was like a love bomb exploded right in my face. Honestly, my first thought to myself was, “Oh great. Just what every new widow wants to see the day before Valentine’s Day. Fun!” After I made my snarky comment to myself (which I know Brian would have appreciated), I posted a picture of the balloons on Facebook instead: “I like to think this was Brian’s way of sending me a Valentine’s this year. He always did surprise me.” Even though I had a snarky moment, I tried to reflect on what I *did* have with Brian, what this day meant, and used it as a reminder of our love.



Later that day I recovered from my cold, only to be greeted by a stomach bug. I like to call these back-to-back illnesses, “The Daycare Plagues.” Every 5-20 minutes for a good part of the evening, I had to hurriedly pick up Jonas, rush to the bathroom, and proceed to be sick as a dog while a screaming toddler tried to grab at my knees and climb into my lap while sitting on the toilet. A true “mom moment”.



The next day I felt better and spent much of that time taking care of business again. One of the first items on my to-do list was to finish paying for Brian’s and my cemetery plots. As I’m writing the date on the check – Feb. 14, 2020 – it struck me what day it was. I was writing a check for my husband’s cemetery plot on Valentine’s Day. That gave me pause, grief, and just caused utter sadness.



Then, there was a knock on the door. It was FedEx with my license plate from the car that I was selling – I had just removed Brian’s name from the title. My mom sent the license plate back to me so I could turn it back in, and sure enough, I dropped that hard metal on my toe. (I mention that because it was just the cherry on top from the week.)



Quite frankly, I just couldn’t take it anymore. I went back into the living room and proceeded to recount my entire week to Brian’s picture. I told him the story as if it were a stand-up comedy routine. I knew he would appreciate the humor of the situation, all the stress and punches from the week. Afterwards, I broke down crying.



It turns out Valentine’s Day week was harder than I thought it would be.



But actually, I really did enjoy my Valentine’s Day. It turned out to be a pretty great day after all, because I have the most amazing friends and family who showed me so much love and support. So many people sent sweet messages of love and remembrance. A dear friend sent Valentine’s cookies in the mail. Family sent beautiful flowers and chocolates.



And Brian even received Valentines as well. One of our closest friends got several Star Wars-themed Valentines and dedicated them to Brian from me and Jonas, and from other family members. Several of Brian’s friends put those Star Wars Valentines on Brian’s grave, so that he was shown love on this day too.



But the best part of my Valentine’s Day was getting to have lunch with a new friend, a young mom who also lost her husband. She’s an incredibly kind, supportive person, and I feel so lucky to have her in my life now. It was a lunch filled with fun conversation, remembrance, laughter, and new beginnings. Moving forward.



So as much as my first reaction to Valentine’s Day was to create some snarky stand-up routine for Brian (which he’d still be laughing about, by the way), our reactions are many times different after we let it all soak in, reflect, and remind ourselves why we’re grateful and thankful for what we do have.



I am grateful for the love and support of my friends and family on this Valentine’s Day. Brian, I know you are sending your love as well. Jonas and I send ours. Happy Valentine’s Day to the love of my life. I know you’d appreciate both the humor and the love.
