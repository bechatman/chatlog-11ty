Brian and I both found connections in life to TV shows that we enjoyed. Our favorite show was *How I Met Your Mother* (HIMYM).



If you’re not familiar with HIMYM, the show is narrated by Ted, the show’s lead character, who is telling his teenage kids the story of how he met their mother. It’s a comedy and a love story that takes place over nine seasons. The show is really a collection of Ted’s many stories about his dating adventures, legendary times with his friends, and occasional broken hearts before finally meeting his wife and the love of his life. The show writers keep you hooked by never revealing the identity of the mother until the end of season eight, and even then, you don’t find out exactly how she and Ted meet until the very end of the show.



The last season is the love story of Ted and the mother, told with a series of flash-forwards into the future. It’s incredibly heartfelt, and Brian and I realized how much of our own story paralleled this one. Sure, there were differences: Brian and I didn’t date nearly as many people as Ted did…or in such dramatic fashion. (This was TV after all.) But as we progressed in our relationship, we started to identify with and find connections to the show as a symbol of our own relationship.



One of the main symbols throughout the show is a yellow umbrella, which represents the missed connections between Ted and the mother, and by the end of the show has become symbolic of their union and their love. The show makes clear that Ted and the mother were in near orbit of one another over the years – they would independently visit the same club or be in the same classroom. Ted even dated the mother’s roommate – stepping foot inside her apartment but never glimpsing sight of her. Through their many missed connections, the yellow umbrella goes back and forth between them – originally the possession of the mother, it’s eventually found by Ted, only to end up back with the mother again years later. When Ted and the mother ultimately meet, they’re standing underneath the yellow umbrella in the rain.



Similarly, Brian and I were in the near orbit of one another for the five years before we met. We were two degrees separated from each other and never knew it. We each had friends that knew each other. I lived two buildings down from Brian’s best friends. I talked to those friends every single day for four years when we would pass each other while walking our dogs, never more than a smile or a hello. Brian was two buildings down from me on countless occasions when he would visit them for dinner or to hang out…I wonder if we ever passed in the parking lot. We happened to meet two weeks after those friends moved away.



Another one of Brian’s friends worked two floors above me in the same building for several years. Brian and I even attended the same Eddie Izzard show in Dallas, unaware of each other in the audience.



Once we began dating, the yellow umbrella became our symbol – for our missed connections and our union when the time was right for both of us. It was the symbol of us and our love.



HIMYM also was about finally finding that person that appreciated and connected with you on all those quirks that no one else appreciated or connected with. It was about losing hope of finding love, only to find it shortly after. It’s a show about everything that leads you to finding the person you’re meant to be with and spend the rest of your life with.



It’s why when Brian and I got married, we incorporated several references to HIMYM into our wedding – Brian wore a ducky tie at the rehearsal dinner, there was a yellow umbrella at our ceremony, our guestbook was a blue guitar (a reference to the blue French horn in the show), and my nephew was our “ring bear”, carrying my childhood bear with our wedding rings tied to it down the aisle.



But in the end, HIMYM is also a show about loss. It’s a show about losing your one true love, ultimately becoming a single parent with young children. Brian and I didn’t see that coming. We connected to so many other parts of the show but never knew we’d connect to that one last thing. That would not have been lost on Brian. Brian would have seen that. It’s why at Brian’s funeral, I placed a yellow umbrella on his casket.
