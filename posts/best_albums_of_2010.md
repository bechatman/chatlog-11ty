  While people worry about the gig economy's negative impact on worker pay, the
  business world has long been trying to reduce transaction costs with their own
  form of gig workers. And the results have been ... mixed.

Los Angeles International Airport Terminal 3 is quiet at 7 a.m., save the occasional “Go Frogs!” from the handful of purple-clad TCU fans who waited an extra day to head home.

The folks in red are quieter every time they hear it. 

In one of the world’s busiest airports, I am completely alone at my gate — three hours early — burning my way through my 2010 Top Ten list and rearranging the order yet again. 2010 marked my peak of personal indecision, and though the albums that made the list were much easier to pick than in 2009, it is only fitting that I constantly change my mind about which one goes where.

So, before I change my mind again or my flight starts boarding, I am closing the book on 2010 with my “best of” countdown.

## 10\. Alkaline Trio, “This Addiction”

Though considerably weaker than their previous albums, I have to include “This Addiction” at the bottom of the list strictly for the amount of time I spent with it. I went to see Alkaline Trio in March shortly after the album was released, and it spent a week in almost exclusive rotation on my iPhone so I could be the annoying guy singing along with every song. It is a catchy album with some great hooks and quotable lines, but the Hot Topic-friendly themes are beginning to wear a little thin.

## 9\. Midlake, “The Courage of Others”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Midlake" data-album="The Courage of Others"></div>

I was perhaps overenthusiastic when Midlake finally released their follow-up to 2006’s “Trials of Van Occupanther,” so it is understandable that this album collected virtual dust on my hard drive for a couple of months after its release. Once I finally put it into my regular rotation, the album proved to be more consistent than its predecessor, though without as many standout tracks. There isn’t a “Roscoe” to draw people in, but every song is beautifully crafted with an ominous tone that can raise goosebumps when listening on a 2 a.m. drive back from Dallas.

## 8\. The Whigs, “In The Dark”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="The Whigs" data-album="In The Dark"></div>

This is one of those albums that was buried in the multiple gigabytes of music picked up from a friend, so it took a couple months to bubble up to the surface. My obsession with this album started when the track “Kill Me Carolyn” started coming up on shuffle. Later “Someone’s Daughter,” “I Don’t Even Care About The One I Love” and “I Am For Real” popped up. Soon after, I the full album was on repeat. I didn’t evangelize this group or research them way I do others, but I dropped in at least one song in every playlist I put together.

## 7\. Against Me!, “White Crosses”

This album was part of the same batch as The Whigs and became playlist fodder in the same way. This one jumps a place to make up for past insults. I’m not sure if I had them confused with someone else, but I swore I hated Against Me! I finally gave White Crosses a listen, and it turned out to be incredible. Playing the whole album gets tiresome, but every track hits the spot when on shuffle — except “Ache With Me,” which makes me stabby if I can’t find the skip button.

## 6\. Motion City Soundtrack, “My Dinosaur Life”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Motion City Soundtrack" data-album="My Dinosaur Life"></div>

I can’t tell you why I got into the band. MCS’ members are the people I used to roll my eyes at in high school and they play a brand of pop-punk that I railed against for years. That said, I love every single one of their albums. There is something about combining happy, energetic music with ironically childlike lyrics about being the nerd that just can’t catch a break. “My Dinosaur Life” adds a new dimension to the band as they address the modern quarterlife crisis using the same musical vocabulary they built their sound with. It’s no wonder that I’d love those themes in a year when many of my friends either found themselves out of work or back in school, when my own job was in jeopardy and when any hope for the future was crushed as more “experienced” members of my department were laid off or given a long runway toward new employment. “I’m through with the old school, so let’s commence the winning. I’ve been a good little worker bee; I deserve a gold star.”

## 5\. Broken Bells, “Broken Bells”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Broken Bells" data-album="Broken Bells"></div>

I actually didn’t like Broken Bells when I first heard them on Sound Opinions, but I had to have a new album for my four-hour flight to Seattle to break up my rotation of 90s grunge. So when I tired of the complete Soundgarden catalog, and when I got sick of Nirvana’s back catalog that I overplayed from 1996 to 2000, and when Pearl Jam was just too Pearl Jam, Broken Bells became took over. Thanks to my friend Laura’s “Summer” playlist, Ke$ha’s “Tic Toc” will always take me back to the Battery Tunnel and Katy Perry’s “Teenage Dream” and “California Gurls” make me think of the roads around Queen Anne, but Alaskan Way belongs to “The High Road” and Yesler Way to “The Ghost Inside.”

## 4\. The Henry Clay People, “Somewhere On The Golden Coast”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="The Henry Clay People" data-album="Somewhere On The Golden Coast"></div>

The Henry Clay People’s second album, “For Cheap Or For Free,” was one of my favorite albums of 2009, though it came out in 2008. I managed to catch “Golden Coast” a little sooner. Despite sharing two tracks with the previous album due to a label change (something I normally detest), the album is every bit as wonderful. The new versions of “Working Part Time” and “This Ain’t A Scene” are only slightly different from the originals, but they seem fresh next to new tracks “Slow Burn” and “End Of An Empire.”  Henry Clay People peddle the same nostalgia for college jobs and first apartments as Pavement, but they do it in a way that is palatable to a wider audience.

## 3\. All That Remains, “For We Are Many”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="All That Remains" data-album="For We Are Many"></div>

I may be a metalhead, but let’s face it, most metal is terrible. That said, if I must endure the hundreds of dreadful metal acts to get one All That Remains album, it’s worth it. The band combines virtuosity with speed and ferocity that rivals early Metallica, all while shifting between a powerful singing voice and screaming that is actually musical. They may not be for everyone, but they are one of the best examples of metal in years. “For We Are Many” isn’t their best album (that title belongs to “Overcome”), but it falls just shy. Standout tracks include “Faithless” the title track “For We Are Many” and the ballad “The Waiting One.”

## 2\. Cee Lo Green, “The Ladykiller”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Cee Lo Green" data-album="The Ladykiller"></div>

I’ve never listen to much R&B/Soul (and the pop that borrows heavily from it), generally because it delves into religious themes or drags on far too long. Everyone else loves “Thriller” but I can’t stand any of the songs beyond second chorus. Add the genre’s uncomfortably earnest lyrics and you’ve lost me. Cee Lo’s Band of Horses cover and the ubiquitous “Fuck You” drew me in, though, so I gave the album a try. What I found was an album that retains all of the things I actually like about R&B/Soul while tempering the elements I hate with humor and humility. The opener “Bright Lights, Bigger City” repackages the “Thriller” sound in an epic song that ends right when you feel it should. “Satisfied” flips the classic sexual themes of the genre on its head to talk about faked orgasms. I could do without the creepy “Bodies,” but this is the first R&B album I can love start to finish.

## 1\. Ted Leo and The Pharmacists, “The Brutalist Bricks”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Ted Leo and The Pharmacists" data-album="The Brutalist Bricks"></div>

Since I started listening to Ted Leo, 2004’s “Shake the Sheets” has been my favorite album. Every track was great and it tackled weighty themes with great lyrics. It was everything a protest album should be. I thought 2007’s  “Living With The Living” was the start of a slow decline from that peak, but “Brutalist Bricks” shows that there is a lot of fight left in the 40-year-old punk rocker. The album’s A side tackles some of the same issues with six years of new perspective and covers some new issues, including an apt dissection of the music industry with “Ativan Eyes.” The B side doesn’t rise to the same level as the first tracks, but it keeps you hooked. “Brutalist Bricks” doesn’t unseat my favorite TL album, but it is a strong second that gives me hope for a new number one in the next few years.
