During the first couple of weeks after losing Brian, I was in a state of shock, going in between states of mourning, anger, denial – essentially starting to go through the stages of grief. After the funeral, Jonas and I went down to my parents’ house for Christmas. My nights were like mini-therapy sessions with family – listening to me talk about Brian, my feelings, my fears, my grief.

My amazing sister would put her girls to bed at her in-laws and then drive all the way back into town just to be with me. We would stay up until 11 pm each night, just talking. She was my lifeline getting through those early days.

One night as we were talking and crying, she looked up at me and said, “Sarah, I know you’re mourning more than just the loss of Brian.” Tears swelled up in my eyes. I had already been thinking these thoughts, but it didn’t quite hit me until she said it out loud. She was talking about our second baby, our growing family. Now, the second baby that would never be. The family of four in our dreams would now just be a family of two.

I was 36 years old. I had just lost my husband. My time for having more babies was over. It was taken from me that night, along with Brian.

I was grieving for the loss of my growing family, for the possibility that was no more.

We are incredibly fortunate to have Jonas, our sweet, happy, healthy baby boy. Many people don’t even get that. But I did feel a second loss from that night. I had already started to love my second child with Brian, not even yet conceived. The hopes we had for the four of us suddenly became the reality of the two of us.

Brian and I had always talked about having two children. I liked growing up in a set of three, but we agreed that given our age, the cost of raising a family, and just jobs and life…well, two would be a good number. Jonas wouldn’t be an only child. He’d have a buddy. Life would be the four of us and Bella.

We even talked about names. I liked Luke for a boy. Brian liked Lucas. Lucas would have been a great name. If it was a girl, my favorite name was Hannah. Brian liked Hannah, but he really liked Lorelai (and we would call her Rory) – yes, from *Gilmore Girls*.

Brian loved *Gilmore Girls*. I think he loved the connection, strength, and perseverance of Lorelai, her bond with Rory, and how they had this amazing life just the two of them. I know Brian would hope for parallels for me and Jonas.

I think Hannah Lorelai would have been a great name.

The conversation had started to come up here and there. When would we start trying again for baby #2? Jonas was about to turn one. We didn’t want our kids to be too close together but thought 2-3 years apart would be good. Although, I don’t think we were quite there yet. We were still settling into Jacksonville and new jobs. Life was stressful as is. Maybe near the end of the summer would be a better time to start trying. We never did make a decision but figured we’d decide later in the year.

I wasn’t prepared to say goodbye so soon…not to Brian, and not to the hope of our second child.

When Jonas and I returned to Jacksonville, my mom started to help us organize our life, to potentially prepare to move if we needed to. I cried and grieved as I packed up baby clothes, bottles, the activity mat, the bouncer seat, pump parts, my nursing pillow. I was grieving all over again for this larger family we’d never have. Each one of those items had been stored away with care, love, and anticipation for the next time, when we’d pull it back out in two years’ time for our next son or daughter. The reality hit me that it would never be used again, at least not in our house by our family.

I allowed myself to grieve, but then I focused on the joy and the love. I remembered all the happy memories of Brian with Jonas, wearing these outfits – the poop, the spit-up, and the overwhelming cuteness. The joy of seeing Brian with Jonas. His favorite outfit was the green-striped pajamas with the monkey on the front. He called it Jonas’ “monkey suit.”

I didn’t want to part with the baby clothes. Those were memories and tangible items from our last year together, our one and only year that we got to have as a family of three. But instead of holding onto those clothes, never to be worn again, I focused on the future. I focused on the new. I wanted to see joy and love with these clothes again, and I can’t wait to see them on my new nephew, perhaps being born at this very moment, when he wears these adorable clothes.

I never got my family of four, but that’s okay, because our family of two will really always be a family of three.

Brian, you’ll always be with us, and I promise to get Jonas another monkey suit one day.
