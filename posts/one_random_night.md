I never thought in a million years I would ever have to utter the words, “I’m a widow.” Well, maybe when I was 80 or 90 years old, but never at the age of 36. I never thought I’d be a single mom, especially to a one year old. I had married the love of my life, my best friend. We had to wait awhile until we met each other, but he was worth the wait. We were 31 when we met.

Life was finally happening for us. We found love, marriage, were moving forward in our careers, and in 2018 we became parents to the most amazing little baby in the whole world. Our lives were complete with happiness, joy, and just unconditional love for each other and our child. We were making plans. We were hoping to be able to get a home someday soon, one near good schools once we had settled into our new jobs. We were ready to finally start that settled part of life, putting down roots and having potlucks with the neighbors. Brian never wanted to live in the suburbs, but we compromised. I could have my house with a yard and fireplace, so long as he could have a sound-proofed music room. Deal!

All that changed on one random night. It was just a random day. We were tired and stressed from work. Jonas had struggled going to sleep. We put together leftovers for a late dinner. We had plans for the following day. We were going to buy Jonas his first pair of shoes. Brian wanted to go to a guitar store to buy a new amp he had been eyeing. It was just your typical weekend day. And that is one of the biggest lessons from all of this. Death does not give you written notice. For most of us with non-terminal illnesses, it will strike out of nowhere. It did for Brian.

Brian died from a major heart attack from 100% stenosis in his LAD (left anterior descending artery), a “widow maker” heart attack as they call it. At the time he died, we had no idea what had caused the heart attack. Brian was healthy. We learned about the blockage in his LAD from the autopsy. We learned that Brian had advanced coronary artery disease and had been sick for many years, likely for more than a decade. We had no idea. As of his last doctor’s appointment, Brian did not have high cholesterol. He did not have high blood pressure. He was not obese. Brian was not a smoker. He did not exhibit any symptoms of coronary artery disease, including shortness of breath or chest pain. He was fine. There was literally no way to have known about Brian’s heart disease. There was no way we could have saved him. It just was.

It just was. Those were the cards Brian were dealt, likely from a genetic predisposition to heart disease. Experiencing the loss of your spouse, or anyone close to you unexpectedly, makes you realize you can only have control over certain things in life. Your own mortality is not one of them. We all have to face the fact that we will all die someday. For the lucky ones, you don’t have to face that fact until you’re in your 70s, 80s, or 90s. For the unlucky ones, well, it can happen much earlier. An early death is just cruel. It’s one of life’s main injustices. It’s tragic. It’s horrible. It’s devastating. As I say about Brian, it f*ing sucks! Times a 100!! Times a million!!

Brian was only 35 years old. We only got to be in each other’s lives for 4 years, 7 months, 2 weeks, and 3 days. We got to be married for just over 3 of those years. Brian only got to love and hold his baby for 1 year and 4 days. I am grateful for every single one of those days. I am grateful that any of those moments were not cut short by even a day. Jonas and I have a lifetime of love that even death cannot take from us. Brian will always be with us. His love will always be with us and will continue to shape the people we are and the lives that we lead.

Losing Brian will always be a reminder that we don’t have a say of when it’s our time to go. Death does not care if you are married, in love, or have children. In fact, death tends to come to many of us when we have all of those things. At least Brian got all those things, even just for a little while. I don’t like the phrase “at least...”. I feel it tries to take away from the grief and cover it up a little. There’s no bandaid for grief. It punches you in the stomach, and there is no relief. You just have to experience it, even if the pain seems unbearable at times. But, I am grateful Brian did experience love, got to experience all the amazing things life does offer us, and got to experience the joy of our family.

Life is both beautiful and tragic, and we cannot experience the love without the latter. So, I will embrace my pain and my grief for Brian. The gut-wrenching pain I feel for his loss is the measure of the love we have for each other. Therefore, I am grateful for that pain.
