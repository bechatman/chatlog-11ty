There is no such thing as a bad year for music. If you think it's been a bad year, you aren't listening to the right music. 

That's what I've always heard but, 80 albums later, 2012 proved the point. While I certainly have that many albums from recent years, I probably came to those albums at least a couple years later, completely missing the band when their album is released. What changed? I started casting a wider net and drawing from more diverse sources. In the end, though, the best albums of year are familiar names.

It doesn't matter how tolerant of other genres you are, you still like what you like.

## Top 10 of 2012:

### 10. Cloud Nothings, "Attack on Memory"

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Cloud Nothings" data-album="Attack on Memory"></div>

There's no shortage of bands doing a throwback 90s sound. Shoegaze and grunge are starting to pop up again, even without the return of My Bloody Valentine and Soundgarden. Where "Attack on Memory" sets itself apart is that it is a throwback that doesn't feel like a throwback. This 8-song album made me feel like I did when I was listening to this kind of music in middle school, but it doesn't sound like a direct copy of bands from that era. 

### 9. Redd Kross, "Researching the Blues"

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Redd Kross" data-album="Researching the Blues"></div>

Speaking of resurrgent sounds, 2012 also saw the return of the some big-name power pop (which is to say not that big-name), but the only one that really caught my attention was Redd Kross. The band dates back to the late 70s, but they never hit big despite praise from critics. Now on Merge Records, the band returned after 15 years with 10 incredibly catchy, fast-pace tracks that form the best album they've written. It's straight-forward rock 'n' roll filtered through a punk production style, and I haven't gone a week without listening to it at least once since it came out this summer.

### 8. The Shins, "Port of Morrow"

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="The Shins" data-album="Port of Morrow"></div>

I first heard The Shins on the "Garden State" soundtrack like most of the world. At the time, I was listening to progressive metal and the like almost exclusively, but the band hooked me. My shifting taste in music is partially a credit to James Mercer's songwriting, and this album is one of my favorites. Many have criticized Mercer's move to dense production from the minimalist sound of the early albums, and this collection clearly feels more like Broken Bells than The Shins. But I see that as a benefit. I may have appreciated the old minimalist sound, but that progressive metalhead in me still wants complex production. Great songs and a rich soundscape: What's not to love?

### 7. Motion City Soundtrack, "Go"

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Motion City Soundtrack" data-album="Go"></div>

Poster boys for the emotionally stunted, Motion City Soundtrack consistently delivers albums that have all of the energy of a teenage pop punk group despite band members being closer to 35. But how does a band that built their career on the idea that (and the song) "The Future Freaks Me Out" avoid sounding contrived? Listening to "Go" you realize that the group has no filter on their inner-19-year-old. Situations change and they certainly show some kind of wisdom, but it's all through the eyes of the same 19-year-old mind. I'm not sure what it says about me that I still love their music, but I also don't care. 

### 6. The Henry Clay People, "Twenty-Five for the Rest of Our Lives"

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="The Henry Clay People" data-album="Twenty-Five for the Rest of Our Lives"></div>

While their music has been characterized as slacker anthems, it is better described as nostalgia for lack of responsibility: Part-time jobs, poorly furnished apartments and the trappings of 20-something life (or lack thereof). In "25," the band's fourth full-length (second on the TBD label), HCP are once again following their thematic formula, but with a slight twist. While there is the usual dose of fear of growing up, songs like "Living Rooms" and "EveryBandWe'veEverLoved" show the band examining the hollow, directionless feeling that sets in as the extended adolescence of modern life morphs into adulthood. The album at least equals if not exceeds previous efforts. 

### 5. The Riverboat Gamblers, "The Wolf You Feed"

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="The Riverboat Gamblers" data-album="The Wolf You Feed"></div>

Now on their sixth album, these local boys (who now live in Austin) have turned in some of their strongest songwriting to date. Though I generally skip the album's lead single "Comedians," there isn't a bad song on the album. In fact, like all the best Riverboat Gamblers tunes, they channel the feeling of their shambolic live performances. This outing shows more control than chaos than past efforts as the tempos have coalesced into a slow burn. "The Wolf You Feed" makes for a great introduction to the Gamblers if you don't yet know them.  

### 4. The Gaslight Anthem, "Handwritten"

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="The Gaslight Anthem" data-album="Handwritten"></div>

After the less-than-stellar "American Slang," a major label debut was sure to put older fans off the band once and for all. Instead, the group managed to update their sound in a way that keeps the relentless pacing of their more punk-influenced material, but uses their wider set of influences to an album that is at home in almost any rock genre. On paper, their lyrics look to be high-school-diary bad, but something about the way Brian Fallon sings them makes the songs incredible—something they must have picked up from their time around Bruce Springsteen.

### 3. Eric Harvey, "Lake Disappointment"

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Eric Harvey" data-album="Lake Disappointment"></div>

Life never quite lives up to what you thought it would be ... well at least it doesn't if you are a realist. If you are so positive (or blinded by shear luck) that you don't believe that, you will probably hate this album. For those of us who feel the post-boomer platitude that "you can accomplish anything and be anything" just set a generation up for ... well ... dissappointment, then "Lake Disappointment" offers a thoroughly contemporary take on heartbreak and failure to achieve—two topics that are fundamental building blocks of good music. The lyrical themes manage to inspire while, at the same time, warn of the potential downsides that come from inspired action.

### 2. Father John Misty, "Fear Fun"

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Father John Misty" data-album="Fear Fun"></div>

Say what you will about clean living, folk singers on mushrooms seems to be a consistent winner in rock history. Josh Tillman's move from a non-starter solo career into the then up-and-coming Fleet Foxes gave him just enough clout to try something completely off the wall, and he delivered. After a move to California from the Pacific Northwest, he created his Father John Misty persona, which turned into a genre-bending album. Every track is fun, even when it feels like it should be sad. There are equal doses of comedy and authentic emotion, and it is enough to make for one of the best albums and live shows of 2012.

### 1. Nada Surf, "The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy"

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Nada Surf" data-album="The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy"></div>

You might say this placement is rigged, but I don't care. I love Nada Surf. While this album isn't as inventive or original as others on the list, it continues to up the ante on Nada Surf releases. I like every one of their albums more than the last one, and the only fault I find is that they are too short and there is too much of a gap between them. The lyrics on this album are infinitely quotable, and the addition of a second guitarist has opened up the sound. They may not be pushing boundaries, but they are constantly improving their work.

## Most Anticipated Albums

While most are still rumors of bands in the studio, there are a few releases that could find their way onto this list next year or they could be painfully disappointing:

1. Telekinesis (due in April)
2. Ted Leo & The Pharmacists 
3. Tool
4. Metallica
5. Trivium
6. Bad Religion (release set for January)
