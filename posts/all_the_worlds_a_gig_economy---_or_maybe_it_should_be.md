title: All the world's a gig economy... or maybe it should be
description: >-
  While people worry about the gig economy's negative impact on worker pay, the
  business world has long been trying to reduce transaction costs with their own
  form of gig workers. And the results have been ... mixed.

Have you ever thought about how many business deals are strictly for the purpose of accessing labor without the investment or expertise required to actually hire employees?

A 2018 NPR/Marist poll showed that nearly [20 percent of employees are contract workers](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/578825135/rise-of-the-contract-workers-work-is-different-now), but not all of those positions are created equal. Where a freelancer may pad their rates to handle volatility and have several clients, contractors often get the same pay rates as their full-time counterparts, but without the access to benefits.

Contract work is often lumped into the same sort of business criticism we hear about Uber, Lyft, Postmates and the rest of the gig economy: Companies don't want to pay their workers properly, so they use loopholes to avoid treating them like employees. While I am sympathetic to this argument, the reality is that flexibility costs much more than just hiring people. There is a bigger reason this is happening, and the gig economy may be the solution, not the cause. 

## By the numbers

Due to the arcane tax code and the variety of perks employers provide, it is hard to say what an employee costs across the board, but we can make some educated guesses. A $50,000-per-year employee costs about $69,111 when you take into account payroll taxes, a 6% retirement match, [$5,711 in health coverage](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/how-much-does-group-health-insurance-cost) and a 5% buffer for other benefits â€” far less than what is paid to contractor agencies.

Without pouring through contracts and just going by what I've seen, federal contractor rates are between 80% and 120% overhead ([though some federal employees have claimed as high at 160%](https://forum.federalsoup.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=61874#post714185)), meaning a $50,000 employee costs as much as $110,000 a year. Some of that does go to health care since these are long-term contractors working full time, but much of that goes to the company for administering staff or just profit.

## The hidden contractor

Forgotten in the discussion of contract work is the agency. 

Marketing, PR, web design, advertising ... you name it, the priniciple is the same. Hiring an agency is the worker friendly version of the contractor. You get skilled people quickly, and you can fire them easily. Often the teams are much more experienced than anyone they could bring on staff, and they have better team cohesion with each other, but they are loyal to the agency and not the company they do work for, unlike contractors. Having a sales team constantly working to bring in new contracts lets people stay with agencies for years ... most of the time. 

The costs are very much on par with contractors, though. A marketing agency could cost $110 to $500 per hour based on the project, but the individual workers see much less. Even with three people and a project manager working on a task at $30 per hour each, the agency has to collect well over double the rate. In both of these cases, there is likely enough work to warrant keeping the same people on full time, and you are paying enough to do it, but the trade off is that you get an experienced, higher caliber team.

It is easy to look at agencies and contractors as the light side and the dark side of temporary employment. There are many complaints of mistreatment of [contract employees in federal positions](https://www.contractormisconduct.org/about-fcmd) or even [major companies like Facebook](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa), and contract workers are often subjected to much harsher work environments or conduct expectations than their full-time co-workers. Many agencies are guilty of the same things, though, and the principles who run the business stand to benefit from profitability much more than the average agency worker.

As frustrating as this is, the current situation is responding to a market need. It costs money to meet the need and there has to be an incentive for companies to provide contract services, but the gig economy offers a new way to work that could fundamentally change the way we work.

## What's standing in the way of change

To change things, you need to iron out some of the things that lock people into jobs.

The most obvious is health care. If your health care is tied to your employer, then losing your job means an expected spike in costs, be it through COBRA or a new plan. It also forces you to work more than may be necessary. To qualify for insurance at most companies, you have to work 29 hours per week. Putting aside the people who are only given 28 hours to avoid triggering that requirement, it sometimes forces you into a full-time job when you would be better off part time. Many people with families would love to have just 4-day weeks or 6-hour days and they would be willing to take the pay cut, but may not want to leave their company or lose their insurance.

The next big obstacle is a lack of real credentials. Companies are already prone to outsource tasks they aren't qualified for, so we can't expect them to magically learn how to hire all skills and start paying that overhead to employees directly. There needs to be a way in every field to say you meet minimum requirements or that you have achieved certain levels of proficiency without a hiring processes that puts you through a bunch of tests with no guarantee you won't have to do it all again for another prospective employer.

The obstacle that I find most frustrating, though, is job hunting. Applying for jobs is, in itself, a full-time job. You have to have flexibility to take meetings, sometimes with little notice. Some employers tell you your application status, but some are just collecting resumes and won't respond at all. Others have too many applicants and only contact the ones they are interviewing. Sometimes postings are targeted at a specific person and only posted as a legal requirement. Some postings are for jobs that don't exist because contractors are bidding for jobs, and they are looking for people to put forward. That last point may require you to apply for the same job three or four times with different contractors for the possibility of getting it.

The common saying is that it is easier to find a job when you have one, but it is also much harder to put in the work to find that job. That's how people trapped in dead-end positions. This is where recruiters and job placement services are actually a great improvement over the job posting approach, but that is contributing to the overhead of hiring workers.

The elephant in the room, though, is that companies really don't need someone 40 hours per week. [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) called out what we have all seen: Many jobs are just bullshit. Employers feel like they need to find things for people to do to fill their time rather than just letting people get paid to do a job. Instead of a $30-an-hour job with a bunch of busy work, we could just as easily do a $60-an-hour job with fewer hours and the same take home and create more jobs by putting money into the economy.

## Gig as a solution

Though it has been a tool to under pay people to date, maybe the gig economy is the real answer to all of this. Using technology to overcome these transaction costs, we might be able to create a much more resilient system. 

We are seeing hints of this with products that match candidates to employers (Indeed Prime or ZipRecruiter, for example). Sites like [Gun.io](https://www.gun.io/), [X-Team](https://x-team.com/) and others heavy vet candidates and then connect them up to clients like a contractor agency, but the employees charge freelance rates. They just have the backing of a company.

Imagine the next step of this evolution.

1. You either pay for your own health insurance, or we finally recognize that health care is a human right and handle it through taxes. 
2. You have a set of services you can go to for your profession to get credentials and see a pay range possible at your skill level, then you set your rate and work schedule. You are then matched with companies and can choose to work for one who has a lot of need or several who have lesser needs. 
3. If you lose your position, something else is sent your way, almost like in an agency today. 

This is one of many directions this could go, and it ignores how so much of the hiring process is mired in outdated legal CYA from both government regulation and business self-regulation.

Seeing all the ways markets have responded to employment needs shows how businesses can naturally adapt to regulation, but we need regulation that can adapt to eliminate the systems that harm workers so there is room for the good ideas to flourish.
