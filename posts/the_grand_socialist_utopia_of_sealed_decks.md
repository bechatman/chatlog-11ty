We like to talk about how everyone is created equal, but it takes about two seconds of thought to realize it's more complicated than that.

While everyone should be equal under the law, we are all far from equal in other aspects. Genetic predispositions to disease or ability, our body types, the environment we grow up in, our nutrition, our family's economic status, the values of our community ...  these are just the tip of the iceberg in how resources can make preexisting inequities into stark differences. 

In the world of Magic, these same factors influence how well you perform when you play. When players have access to roughly the same quality of cards and exposure to the game, their performance is much more evenly matched; show up to a game store with an entry level deck, though, and you will get trounced by thousand-dollar decks piloted by software developers that live and breathe Magic. 

## A Better World, A More Equal World
Limited formats are a way of providing a fairer environment by making resource distribution into a lottery. In the most restrictive form — sealed — each player is given six packs of cards and their deck can only use cards from those packs. While the most experienced players may know better which cards work together, the randomness of the packs ensures that everyone has an equal shot at the best cards, potentially making it possible for casual players and competitive players to have fun matches together.

Looked at strictly in the context of a sealed event, Magic played in this way is an example of a planned economy. The government, Wizards of the Coast, determines how much of each resource (Cards) is available in each pack and how they are distributed across all packs. No one has access to more or better-quality packs.

This type of equality of opportunity doesn't necessarily change who fails and who succeeds in the grand scheme of things. The difference is that, when you make the the best and the worst decks cost the same to obtain, sealed tournaments are a true meritocracy.

## A Socialist Island in a Capitalist Sea
This equality comes at a price. At $4 per pack, this is a high-tax environment, costing $24 per event or more.

Just like people pay taxes into resources like schools and parks they don't use in addition to roads or transit infrastructure they do use, most decks only use 22 to 25 of the 90 cards you get in your six packs. But unlike these publics goods, cards you aren't using don't go to other players whose deck might benefit from them during the event. In command economies like the old Soviet Union, this kind of central planning led to a black market for trading resources. Luckily, it is hard to create a black market inside of an event, but playing anything other than sealed immediately breaks down the equality of this utopia.

Let's face it: $24 every once in a while is fine. No one is paying that price weekly. Once the tournament is over, players could trade among themselves and play with the same cards in formats that allow you to bring pre-constructed decks. But the minute you allow cards to be brought in from other sources, the single-card market brings the impact of income inequality into the game.

Any pre-constructed deck format allows players with greater means to obtain more copies of the best cards much more efficiently than trading. Those who can only trade cards might be out of luck. 

Like a commune, some players sell cards from sealed events to fund their entry into more sealed events and never leave their utopian world. If the cards you get don't have as much value, the cycle breaks down.

## Free Market Reforms
If too many players sell and trade their way into other formats, the number of sealed events may decline if more players aren't brought in to sealed. Fewer sealed events may lead some casual players to stop playing altogether.

Assuming all players aren't having enough children to fill the gap and you don't have any immigrants (new players) interested in the way the sealed format works, you have to drop taxes and better utilize resources to keep the people you have or attract more. Enter the other big limited format: Draft. 

At the cost of only three packs (about $12), this is a lower-tax environment. Additionally, resources are utilized more effectively as players pick a card from a pack, then pass the remaining cards around the table and pick a card from the pack passed to them. That means that you may pick a blue, green or white card before you decide to build a red/black deck, but the vast majority of your cards will be in your colors and potentially usable in your deck. And, as you'd expect, the decks tend to be more powerful, even if there is less investment in cards.

Unlike sealed, in which game play itself is never warped by the existance of a market outside the game and players have equal access to resources, draft automatically skews to better players and is easily corrupted by the existence of the single-card market outside the game. 

If too many people draft the same color, those cards will disappear from the pool quickly and dilute the effectiveness of that color in the matches to follow. Better players read signals on this, and can more adeptly monopolize the colors people are ignoring. This gives experienced players a much bigger advantage than they would have in sealed, and the results are usually indicative of that. On balance, though, it is worth it if it keeps casual players participating in events. 

If all players went into a draft with the same intention of competing, these rules would seem like an improvement. This sort of system, though, also incentivizes a form of crime: Money drafting. Some players intentionally draft cards based on their value outside the game. While this can be fine if it fits their colors, some players just harvest as many good cards as possible regardless of how it impacts their game. For players that finance their entry into events by selling cards after, a money drafter could reduce the number of events they can play. Since the crime is rarely detectable, cash-strapped players are incentivized to become money drafters themselves, which makes the game itself a capitalist enterprise instead of just a game. If the actual game play starts to suffer from this behavior, it drives away the casual players by creating an unhealthy environment. 

As with real socialism, existing in a capitalist world has a way of warping incentives for all but the most ardent believers in the philosophy. Even if you create a way to address inequities and achieve fairness, you can't control how what happens outside of your system impacts players inside it, and systems must adapt to survive. If players stop acting in good faith, it is all downhill from there.
