Limiting a top albums list to those released in a year is pointless.

Critics have been releasing their top albums lists over the past month and, being the music geek (and failed critic) that I am, I wanted to follow suit. It seemed simple enough: look at all the albums that came out in calendar year 2009 and pick five. I was stumped at 10.

It is easy for a critic. The job requires you to talk about what is new, not about what you play on your iPod. Never mind that the best album of 2008 may be on the top of the trash heap by the time 2009's list hits the shelves.

## The Top ~~Five~~ 10 Albums of 2009

I spent a week coming home after work and looking through a playlist of every album I owned that came out in 2009. By Wednesday, I had it together:

- Alice in Chains - Black Gives Way to Blue
- AFI - Crash Love
- Phoenix - Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix
- Mastodon - Crack the Skye
- Silversun Pickups - Swoon
- Saosin - In Search of Solid Ground
- Atreyu - Congregation of the Damned
- Metric - Fantasies
- Electric Six - Kill
- Decemberists - Hazards of Love

The trouble came with the order. Silversun Pickups and The Decemberists took a hit because I overplayed their albums after buying them. Alice in Chains and AFI got extra points for being unexpectedly good albums, but Mastodon put together the first accessible prog metal album I have ever heard. The Bravery and Them Crooked Vultures were eliminated, but they are much newer and I haven't had the same amount of time with those albums when compared to the ones above.

## The Real Top Five Challenge

At risk of sounding even more pretentious than usual, music is a journey. Some albums have to grow on you. Others you can't appreciate until some other band whets your appetite for that style of music, or until your life experience makes it suddenly relevant. There are even times when you won't be able to stand an artist you have counted as your all-time favorite, only to come back around years later.

Keeping that in mind, I wanted to round out the year with the Top Five albums that had the most impact on the music I listened to in 2009, and I want to challenge everyone I know to do the same by way of a Facebook note or blog post.

The rules are simple: It doesn't matter when the albums came out, they just need to have been important to you in 2009. Be viral about it and tag people or just do it for yourself, but I want to see what albums actually made 2009 what it was. If you want to do a top releases list as well, throw it in for good measure.

## Brian's Real Top Five of 2009

### Metallica – Death Magnetic

When Metallica announced their new album, I didn't have a lot of hope based on their recent history. Then it hit. Death Magnetic was the first album in a long time that made me feel the way I did when I put on my first album or the first time I heard Master of Puppets. A year later, almost to the day, I was in American Airlines Center waiting to see Metallica live for the first time in 10 years, having listened to their new album at least weekly since it came out. Death Magnetic renewed my neglected love of metal; it reconciled the musical taste of 25-year-old and 16-year-old me. So as frowned upon as it may be, Metallica made me proud to say, “I am a metalhead.”

### The Replacements — Pleased to Meet Me

Early in 2009, I wanted to fill in a big gap in my musical knowledge between where my parents stopped listening to a lot of new music and when I started: the mid 80s to early 90s. Hüsker Dü and Bob Mould was my first attempt to fill the gap, which was certainly fun, but not life changing. Then I picked up The Replacements' greatest hits. I loved the album and it was clear just how much impact they had on my favorite bands, so I wanted more. Found in a cache of vinyl LPs I nabbed from my uncle, Please to Meet Me was practically glued to the turntable until I went on a great search of every remaining record store in DFW to find The Replacements full back catalog. Now I can be like the hipsters and talk about them like I am a fan from way back (before I could feed myself).

### The Gaslight Anthem – The '59 Sound

I was unmoved by Gaslight when their major-label debut came out in 2008. For the first few months, I only listened when it happened to come up on shuffle. At some point around March, though, I started to seek out the album. Then I grabbed both their other albums. Then I had to see them in concert. Gaslight was the definition of a slow build, but now they are a musical staple.

### The Henry Clay People – For Cheap or For Free

This is just one of those great albums I didn't notice at first. Start to finish, it is absolutely wonderful. It is easily the best album of 2009, even if it did come out in 2008. I just want to thank iTunes for throwing this into a sampler and putting it on my radar.

### Alice in Chains – Black Gives Way To Blue

When Alice in Chains went on tour with a new lead singer, I hated the thought. No one could replace Layne Staley. Then they announced a new album with this new lead singer, and I was adamant that I would not listen to it. Then two things happened: The release date coincided with the Metallica concert, and my new favorite website, Lala, used the law of supply and demand against me. After the concert, I was too wired to go to sleep. I needed more heavy music and someone I followed on Twitter mentioned that Lala had the AIC album for $2.99. The price was right for a nostalgia kick, but what I heard blew me away. Dirt has always been my favorite AIC album, but Black Gives Way To Blue may give it a run for its money. What's more, I actually think that the new singer (whose name I never bothered to look up), may be better than Staley. It may be blasphemy and disrespectful to the dead, but I said it.
