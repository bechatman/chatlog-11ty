One of Brian’s favorite TV shows was NBC’s, *The Good Place*, naturally. He was a philosophy buff…and a huge Kristen Bell fan.

*The Good Place* centers around four individuals that enter the afterlife, known in the show as the “The Good Place.” It’s a place full of quaint streets, nice houses, and all-you-can-eat frozen yogurt. It’s also equipped with a Janet, an all-knowing robotic “person” that knows all things and can answer all questions. However, very soon upon their entrance into The Good Place, the show’s main characters discover this quaint little town is actually “The Bad Place.” The show delves into philosophical questions about what it means to be good and what it means to be human, something that drew Brian into the show…besides Kristen Bell, of course.

But, what if *The Good Place* was actually real and was actually “The Good Place?” What would that afterlife look like, and mostly importantly, what would Brian’s Good Place look like?

It would look like this.

Brian would live in a three-story townhouse, centrally located to town. It would be within a two minutes’ walk to mass transportation, probably a subway, that would run every 2-10 minutes and take him into downtown. Brian’s townhouse would also be within walking distance of a coffee shop, that serves a mean pour-over coffee (Chemex, of course). This coffee shop would never be too crowded, filled with just enough people to make the place feel not empty. As he sips his coffee, he would be quietly listening to various podcasts about current events, the latest elections and the latest Supreme Court decisions here on Earth. (Yes, in Brian’s Good Place he would still keep up with politics and the Supreme Court. I mean, what else would people debate for fun in The Good Place?)

After finishing his coffee, Brian would walk down the street to his local record and music store. He’d spend 30 minutes browsing through the bins, looking for the latest music that he didn’t already have in his collection at home, and try out various guitars. He’d walk down the street to an amazing taco place for lunch, one with great corn tortillas and the best queso.

Brian would spend the afternoon jamming with the best. He’d be in a band with Tom Petty and Neil Peart (drummer from Rush), and perhaps with Cliff Burton (bass guitarist from Metallica). He’d get to learn music from some of the greatest.

He’d also live within walking distance of an amazing burger place and spend his evenings laughing and talking with George Carlin. George Carlin would definitely be a member of Brian’s “Dinner Club” – you know, that imaginary dinner party you can have with anyone dead or alive. George Carlin was an extremely funny and profound man. He had amazing insights into life, ones Brian and I related to well.

After his dinner with George Carlin, Brian would stop by his favorite custard place on his walk home. Brian’s home would be spacious but not too big. He’d have a designated study and music room. He’d have thousands of records, all autographed of course, and have a collection of guitars that he could only dream of while on Earth…but, he’d still toy around with changing out the pickups, just because he could.

In his study, Brian would have bookshelves full of all the books he always wanted to read when he had the downtime here. On those shelves, he’d have first edition, signed copies of the Harry Potter series, of course.

Once home, Brian would proceed to turn on his favorite *Magic The Gathering* YouTube channel and sort his card decks. Or, perhaps he’d watch some *Binging With Babish* or one of his other favorite YouTube channels.

But what I do know is Brian would first go to the kitchen and pour a glass of Far Niente Cabernet. He’d bring that glass of wine into the living room and make a crackling fire in the fireplace. He’d turn on Christmas music and make sure the throw blanket was on the couch. He wouldn’t do these things for himself. Brian didn’t like wine or fires, and he couldn’t stand Christmas music. No, he’d be setting these things out for me. He’d be waiting for the day when I would join him in The Good Place, because my Good Place is Brian’s Place.
