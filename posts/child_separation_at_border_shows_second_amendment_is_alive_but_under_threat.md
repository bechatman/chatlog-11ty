As someone who doesn't own a gun and generally detests them, my thinking about the second amendment has changed over recent years.

I have gone from wanting strict gun laws or bans to realizing that we don't have the governing consensus in this country to enforce the gun laws we have, much less enact new ones effectively. The belief on the right that their guns are the only thing standing between them and government tyranny makes me fearful for the day any real gun laws are enacted.

It is hard to image how immigration officials imprisoning illegal immigrants and separating children from families could alter the way I think about the second amendment. Then [state governors pulled their National Guard troops](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/20/politics/national-guard-border-troops/index.html).

While ostensibly a story of the Trump Administration's capricious disregard for human rights, the actions of these governors reminded me of how some of our founding fathers originally intended the second amendment to be applied — and how the National Rifle Association and others have corrupted it in a way that could remove this valuable protection.

## How Right the Federalists Were
When we think of the National Guard, we tend to think of it as a federal force, but it is actually the last remnant of the "militia" mentioned in the second amendment.

Each state controls its own forces, but the federal government can activate them for specific purposes. How the Guard operates is actually quite true to the way the Alexander Hamilton-penned Federalist No. 29 from 1788 explains it:

> If a well-regulated militia be the most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and the disposal of the body which is constituted the guardian of national security.    

While this line puts the militia at the disposal of the federal government, he also says that the states would be responsible for the appointment of officers and would have the authority to train the militia based on the standards set in Congress. He goes on to explain that the people that make up the militia must be regularly trained to maintain readiness. Citizen soldiers, if you will.

Far from being the enforcement arm of the federal government, the militia was seen as "the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist."

When the governors withdrew or refused to send troops to the border this week, they were channeling Hamilton, Madison and the views of the Federalists who lauded the benefits of a militia as a way to organize a military force in a way that puts a check on excessive federal power. 

> If there should be no army, whither would the militia , irritated by being called upon to  undertake a distant and hopeless expedition for the purpose of riveting the chains of slavery upon a part of their countrymen direct their course, but to the seat of the tyrants…     

In this passage, we see the seeds of the current interpretation of the second amendment: That it protects against tyranny. While second amendment advocates are completely right about that, they disregard the founding father's radical devotion to the principles of organized dissent, not unilateral resistance. Massachusetts' militia forces were already fighting the British, but the Declaration of Independence came as a result of elected officials considering the issue and deciding to contribute their troops to the cause. With the possible exception of Patrick Henry, the founding fathers did not believe in empowering one person or a handful of people to take up arms against the government; they believed in vigorous public debate and using force only when necessary through the consent of the governed.

## We Are Not Descended of Fearful Men

Through motivated reasoning or deliberate misdirection, this structure of organized, elected groups standing up to federal government overreach by refusing or, as a last resort, fighting the federal government has been warped.

While elements of the old ways permeate our traditions and institutions, the clear intent of the founders in 1788 has become much more pliable. 

Ironically, it was a constitutional "originalist," Justice Antonin Scalia, that suddenly derived that the second amendment contained a right to self defense in the 2008 [*District of Columbia v Heller*](http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-290.pdf) decision. Until then, rights to self defense were derived from the "rights reserved to the people" from the ninth amendment. If the state hasn't specifically prohibited or prescribed a method of how you can defend yourself or your family, then you have a right to defend yourself as you see fit. The fact that you are armed for the purposes of ensuring the citizenry is ready in the event of invasion means that guns are among the tools available to you for self defense. 

Scalia's decision to expand the definition of what the second amendment intended was not the result of thoughtful legal scholarship. He was simply the product of a conservative movement that has become captive to the idea that a line of text that specifically calls out state-run militias somehow gives them an absolute right to have any weapons they deem necessary for self defense. This is just the razor's edge of a much worse twisting that we see from NRA TV personality Colion Noir and libertarians like All That Remains lead singer Philip Labonte. 

Far from looking to the text of the constitution or the intent of those who wrote it, they hold the extreme position that the second amendment provides an individual right to defend against the state and, much worse, that they should be allowed to have weapons of a class capable of defending against the US Military for this purpose. Far from being just ahistorical views of people who have (sometimes justifiably) bleak views of government power, this rhetoric is turning the ratchet on discourse about guns to the point where it threatens the rule of law.  

##  The Rule of Law
Despite the view of many of its members that guns are necessary to protect against a tyrannical government, the Republican Party identifies as the "law and order" people. If you break the law, there is zero tolerance — you will be imprisoned. The irony here is that it is completely counter to the American system and the small-government philosophy of the Republican Party.

We say that the United States is a nation of laws because we don't want vigilante justice. The world is less safe if every perceived slight led to the victim or their friends exacting what they feel is justice. Emotions often get in the way, but society values punishment that fits the crime. A disinterested third party is better able to soberly determine what that punishment is.

Since some actions may be illegal but have mitigating factors, a jury of peers determine if the action is justifiable or should receive a lighter punishment.

The result is that laws may restrict individual rights, but if community values are in conflict with the law, there is always a bit of leeway. Individual rights are balanced against the rights of the community by individual members of the community. If enough people in the community believe that a law conflicts with their values, it will be reflected in elected officials that will change the laws. When we say rule of law, what we really mean is that we can handle our problems peacefully through the system instead of going around it. 

Zero tolerance breaks this model. 

It restricts juries by introducing mandatory minimum sentences. It leads to proactive policing, and that requires a much more expansive state apparatus. Proactive policing also leads to more confrontation between criminals and law enforcement and, in turn, more violence.

Where this thinking truly goes off the rails is when you consider the war on drugs. 

Drugs were pervasive, but they were non-violent offenses when Nixon started the "war" as [a means of using state power to attack blacks and liberals](https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie/index.html). Fast forward to the 80s and police were beginning to militarize to deal with drug networks, potentially killing people to enforce the law. In a move that surprised no one who knows the history of prohibition, gangs started arming themselves to defend against the government crackdown and employed violence to keep police out of their business. 

So if you believe you won't get a fair trial and you believe that the government's law is unjustly impacting your right to do business, isn't that tyranny? If agents of the state show up armed to take away your livelihood or actively suppress the rights of your community, wouldn't conservative views of the second amendment require them to believe that firing at police is a constitutionally protected activity?

Fast forward again to the genesis of the Black Lives Matter movement where the way police are trained appears to lead to more violent confrontations with black people than white people, whether there is cause for violence or not. If the black community — rightly or wrongly — believes that police are attacking them, does the second amendment give BLM a constitutional right to become the new Black Panthers and protect communities against police? 

While only the most extreme anti-statist libertarian would agree with that view, that is an inevitable result of the idea that second amendment wants you to defend yourself against tyrannical governments. If you promulgate the idea that guns are there when the system fails, then some people start looking for excuses to claim the system has failed.

## Enter Tyranny
When liberals decry gun nuts, most liberals like myself think of people like Georgia gubernatorial primary candidate Brian Kemp. 

Kemp's political ads ahead of the GOP primary have thrilled his fans and triggered his opponents by depicting himself implicitly [threatening a boy with a shotgun](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/02/georgia-candidate-kemp-triggers-uproar-over-shotgun-ad.html) before a date with his daughter and [forcibly rounding up illegal immigrants with his truck](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/05/10/brian-kemp-illegals-ad/600212002/). This type of ad taps into the visceral view of many Americans that we need to handle problems if the rule of law isn't enough. 

Flip the script, though, and the picture for second amendment proponents isn't so rosy. 

Imagine these policies enacted with the force of the state behind him. What if Kemp sends the Georgia Bureau of Investigation out to round up immigrants on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement? What if he encourages excessive force? At what point are citizens of Georgia allowed to take up arms to stop him?

On many university campuses, [Antifa have resorted to violence](http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/350524-antifa-activists-say-violence-is-necessary) to try and drive away white supremecists (or just anyone they disagree with in any way). If they view police as in league with them, do they have a constitutional right to take up arms against the state?

Motivated reasoning means that if you go looking for examples of tyranny to fight, it doesn't take long to find it. If you think that the police are going to fire at you, how long will it take before arguments about "defending against tyranny" lead you to situations where you fire back? How long until groups like the Branch Davidians start popping up again? How long until there is another Timothy McVey?

As long as "defending the second amendment" means empowering individual distrust of government and the system in general, our country will be less safe. It's time we took a page from the founders and look at the amendment as a check on federal power through democracy, not a call to arms against the state.
