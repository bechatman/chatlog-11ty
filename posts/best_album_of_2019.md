To join in with Sarah’s recent posts in Life and Loss, this is my own take-over of the blog’s Music tab. 

I never intended to post on Brian’s blog. In fact, I never spent much time on it to begin with. However, in the wake of his passing, I feel compelled to pick up the torch. 

Though my own music tastes diverged from Brian’s some time ago, I always enjoyed his writings on music, especially his [Album of the Year lists](https://www.chatlog.blog/music/). It was fun to see which albums had the greatest impact on him each year, and a great feeling of confirmation whenever something we both liked made the list. 

The idea of those lists resonated with me from the very start and got me thinking about which albums struck me the most each year, though I usually never acknowledged them with anything more than a quick Instagram post of the album cover. It’s a fun exercise to keep track of album releases and, at the end of the year, see which ones have stuck around. Maybe something blew your mind at first, but was ultimately a flash in the pan and dropped off your frequent rotation. On the other hand, maybe something bounced around the fringes of your playlists and eventually grew on you as you recognized its worth. 

As I write this in 2020, I enjoy a wide range of screaming styles from high to low, though I still can’t go very far into the “guttural” styles. The more a vocalist sounds like a squealing pig or water draining in a bathtub, the more it takes me out of the music. I remember a time when I echoed my parents’ sentiment toward screaming in music: “It’s just screaming. It’s just noise.” Slowly, things began to challenge this idea. Something in a new song would draw me in. Even though I didn’t like the screaming at first, I was exposed to it a little more, and a little more. I eventually developed preferences over what kind of screaming I liked and didn’t like. Now, here I am giving a recommendation of a brutal death metal album! Go figure.

**“Melancholy” by Shadow of Intent**

I’ll start this take-over with an “album pick,” and my favorite release of 2019: Melancholy, by Shadow of Intent. 

Shadow of Intent is one of those bands that passed me by on several occasions, catching my ear, but never sticking. A song or two off their 2017 album, “Reclaimer”, would crop up on my Spotify Discover Weekly playlist, but while I was impressed by the theatrical atmosphere of the music and the relentless energy, the vocals didn’t quite do it for me, and I would always set the band aside. However, I listen to a lot of The Black Dahlia Murder, so when the single, “A Barren and Breathless Macrocosm,” was released, featuring TBDM vocalist Trevor Strnad, Spotify put it at the top of my suggested songs. I instantly recognized his vocals in the chorus, so after shitting my pants in excitement, my first thought was, “Wait. I don’t know this band, but they must be serious if they got Trevor Strnad.” While guest features can sometimes feel like an expression of, “Hey! Look who we paid to be on our album!” Strnad’s sections feel perfectly suited to the music, and are a nice contribution. His ripping highs combine with relentless blast beats to give stunning contrast between the breakneck chorus and the brutal, trudging breakdown later in the song. As more hotness was revealed with each new single, I eagerly awaited the album’s release.

The thing that first attracted me to Shadow of Intent was their musicality. Listening to “Melancholy” as a cohesive body, the pacing is right on point. The flow from song to song, and even the transitions between sections within songs, carries you on a sonic journey through the whole album. I noticed that they even seemed to dial back the use of gutturals, blending more of the vocals with the atmosphere of the music. 

One of my favorite musical tools from my time in high school and college drumline is metric modulation – the transition from a slow to fast feel (or vice versa) by progressing the subdivision of rhythm, not by changing the actual tempo. This can be easily felt by progressing up or down through a series of duple and triple rhythms: 8th notes to triplets to 16th notes, etc. It’s a tool Shadow of Intent uses very well and perfectly incorporates in songs like “Underneath a Sullen Moon”, where death march triplet bursts threaten to steamroll over you while the transition to 32nd note blast beats pick you back up and thrusts you into the soaring chorus. Similarly, the musical device is expanded upon when moving from “Oudenophobia” into “Embracing Nocturnal Damnation.” “Oudenophobia,” the one and only ballad of the album, provides a welcome break from the onslaught of the first four tracks while never giving you a true escape from the violence. Transitioning into “Embracing Nocturnal Damnation,” the song modulates from triplets in the intro, to 16th notes in the verse, shoving you back into the chaos, like an unstoppable freight train picking up speed.

Another noteworthy track is, “The Dreaded Mystic Abyss.” At ten and a half minutes, it’s an in-depth exploration of how well the band’s music can stand on its own, sans vocals. It uses its time well, showing the band’s depth in musicianship and skill in composition. Each section blends together well, and flows nicely while moving in and out of odd time signatures – the best example being a section which plays with your mind by delivering a straight 4/4 feel on the drums over the rhythm guitar’s constant 7/8 groove.

Giving everything some context is the overall atmosphere of the album – powerful, yet despairing; sometimes feeling like you’re a bug being crushed underfoot; other times feeling triumphant, like you’re rising above. The wash from one feeling to the other and back again conveys a strong sense of internal strife, a theme that I think also prevails in the album artwork: we see a bleak, desolate world surrounding a reflecting pool, which seems to mirror the worlds of the living and the dead. Staring into it is a lone man, possibly between both worlds, contemplating his place in both. As I see him, he grapples with his entire existence and the weight of his own despair, manifesting itself in the wastes that surround him. A great many metal album covers go for busy graphic designs and shock value. “Melancholy”, however, does a fantastic job of depicting an entire realm within a single frame. 

It’s a scene that you can actually feel as you stare into it, like you’re the person staring into this mysterious pool. I’m able to really tap into the vibe of the music and the art, so I find it easy to project my own feelings and experiences onto it all. My 2019 was filled with great joy and terrible tragedy all thrown at me together, with almost no breaks or breathing room, and I feel like everything about “Melancholy” perfectly reflects the feelings that come with that. Sometimes when you take a step outside of yourself to observe it all, you find that you’re just helplessly adrift on life’s undercurrent, be it placid or turbulent – and that’s what I feel in this album.

I posit that “Melancholy” is a modern metal masterpiece, inside and out. If I were to make a “best-of” list reviewing the whole decade of metal, Shadow of Intent would doubtlessly make the list with this late entry heavy-hitter. For now, though, they deservedly earn my nod for “Album of 2019” – a heavy album for a heavy year. 

[Give it a listen](https://open.spotify.com/album/5IgHVlikizQFBPieV1uk8v?si=YRGOZxnJQlGrhxSZ6o3YwA), then another to let it fully sink in. Bask in “Melancholy”.

(By the way, if you just can’t stand the screaming, there is an entirely instrumental version of the album, and it completely stands up on its own!)
