"Australian" may be the closest thing to a quality guarantee when checking out a new band. From Plini to The Preatures, either the continent just puts out a higher quality of musician or the oceans do a great job at filtering out the bad music. 

The latest evidence for this is the Middle Kids.

The Sydney band's debut album, *Lost Friends*, was released May 4, and I've managed to listen to the full album at least five or six times since â€” a rare occurrence these days. Hearing just a few bars of one song will suck me in to the whole album.

The 12-song album builds perfectly upon their 2017 eponymous EP and, in a move I wish more bands would make, they repeat only two tracks.  Those two songs, "Edge of Town" and "Never Start" are standout tracks, with "Edge" earning 12 million Spotify streams as a single. New tracks like "Mistake" and "Tell Me Something" threaten to unseat the champions, though, with earworm hooks and an emotional punch.

Singer and guitarist Hannah Joy's vocals provide much of that feel, with near whispered singing that builds up against shoegazey chords until they erupt. 

*Lost Friends* is a perfect pop album. Every track clocks in at just over the three-minute mark. Songs are perfectly paced to pull you into the next. It will make you smile, but none of this music is disposable. 

Middle Kids kicked off a three-continent tour, which arrives in the US and Canada this Friday. Let's make them feel welcome so they bring more of those great Australian bands back with them.
