After Brian died, family and friends took turns staying with Jonas and me to provide help and support so that we could make it through those first weeks in this new, unexpected life. Jonas and I had company every day for the first six weeks – we were never alone. After that, we slowly eased back into a routine with just the two of us at home, spacing out visits from family and friends. The only way I could stay in Florida, just the two of us, was knowing that help and support was just a plane-ride away and would be coming on a regular basis for the foreseeable future.



Jonas and I eased back into life on our own during week 7. It was one of the hardest weeks of my life, filled with fear and loneliness. I had a lot of strength, too, but it was propped up by knowing Brian’s parents were arriving the following week. Then, after Brian’s parents left, we were alone for two weeks before I started back at work.



I was slowly easing back into the real world, interacting with others again, and going back to my professional life – which wasn’t centered around the business of grief. Even though we didn’t have help at home, it helped me knowing that there was another milestone to look forward to soon, when someone else would be visiting.



During this time, Jonas and I also established a new weekend routine that kept us busy, kept us out of the house, and gave us structure. Our weekends were filled with mini-goals, which helped get us through.



### **A new routine**



We would start each Saturday and Sunday by having breakfast, followed by an episode or two of Sesame Street. Sesame Street was Brian’s thing with Jonas. It was very important to him that Jonas was raised with Sesame Street, and rightfully so. It’s a show filled with amazing life lessons, kindness, and fun musical segments.



After Sesame Street – and more importantly, after a cup or two of coffee – we’d head off to the grocery store. Getting groceries each week used to be filled with stress. It was a chore that none of us looked forward to, and more often than not, Brian and I would often order groceries for delivery after Jonas was born. It was just easier and gave us more time at home with each other.



But now, Jonas and I were in need of a distraction. We would always visit the grocery store early in the morning, before the crowds, and wander down each aisle, even if we didn’t need anything in particular, just to spend more time out of the house. Jonas loves riding in the cart and pointing at various items on the shelves. This grocery outing became our morning ritual on the weekends and something I would come to look forward to.



After we got home from the grocery store, I would feed Jonas a snack while putting away the groceries. Then, we would leave the house again to go to a local, indoor play-place designed for young children 0-5 years old. It provided yet another escape and distraction, one filled with interaction with other parents and other children. We would usually stay about an hour or so, and then we would head home and have lunch. Next was nap time, followed by playtime at home with various FaceTime sessions with the grandparents. Soon it would be dinner time, followed by bath time, followed by even more goodnight FaceTimes with the grandparents.



This was our new weekend routine without Brian. As painful as it was at first, I came to enjoy it.



Each week, I gained more strength and confidence to lead this new life…but also, I always knew that help was just around the corner. That’s what was getting me through. After starting back at work, I would only have to be alone for three weeks before Brian’s cousin would visit us for his birthday. I was really looking forward to this visit, both for the emotional support and for the fun we’d have celebrating Brian and mixing up our usual weekend routine.



### **And then COVID-19 hit…**



Brian’s cousin had to cancel her trip last minute, and with good reason. We couldn’t risk her getting infected, unknowingly spreading the virus, or getting stuck here in Florida if travel bans became widespread.



“That’s okay”, I thought. “We can go another few weeks until Brian’s parents’ visit. We can make it until then. It’s not the end of the world.”



In the meantime, Jonas and I discovered a new weekend escape, thanks to a new friend, who introduced us to our local beach. This beach is filled with shark teeth and other amazing treasures – apparently, the beaches nearby have underwater fossil beds, filled with million-years-old fossilized shark teeth that you can find in the tides and shell beds.



Jonas and I would go to the beach early in the morning, when people were few and far between. We’d lay out our blanket and have a snack (and coffee) while watching the waves, the early morning surfers, and taking in the ocean breeze. Then, we’d spend the next few hours hunting for shark teeth in between sticking Jonas’ feet in the ocean and seeing his face light up with excitement. The beach became our new therapy, our new escape, our way of appreciating the wonders of the world and escaping our grief.



We would only go to the beach twice, but it was something I came to depend on, like oxygen. It was my new way of appreciating something bigger than myself.



But soon enough, as COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and began to spread, stay-at-home orders began, and the beaches started to close. Jonas and I, like the rest of the world, were now confined to our apartment.



“That’s okay,” I thought. “This is only temporary. It will be hard, but we can get by in our apartment. We still have visits to look forward to from Brian’s parents and mine. We’ll be okay.”



Since then, four weeks have gone by. Brian’s parents were supposed to be with us right now. My parents’ trip, scheduled for next month, will likely not happen…or their trip after that.



My support, my help, my relief, my lifeline, has been unexpectedly taken away from me with no end in sight. My anxiety grows every day, not knowing when my next visit – that I had depended on to get through my grief, to get through my new life alone – will come.



My new routines to cope with a life without Brian, ones as simple as strolling the aisles of the grocery store, are gone. My newest escape to the beach is gone.



Yet again, I’m finding myself in a situation of loss, loneliness, and uncertainty. We all are.



This is an incredibly difficult time, not just for me but for all of us, the whole world. We are all grieving – grieving our former lives and routines. Families have been separated, jobs have been lost, weddings and graduations missed, fear and anxiety have taken hold of all that we do. We’re all locked down in our homes, not knowing when we’ll be able to see our friends and family again, not knowing when we’ll be able to go to school again. The “not knowing” is the worst part. Actually, the worst part is the thousands that have already lost loved ones – a reminder of why it’s important we all stay inside and social distance.



We have to remind ourselves: this disruption to our lives is only temporary – the loss of a loved one is not.



Yes, this hard. Yes, this was unexpected, but this is our new reality. Just remember, we are all in this together. We will get through this. It’s hard to accept a new reality, especially one we did not want or did not expect.



I find when grieving, it’s most helpful to establish a routine and, most importantly, to remind ourselves what we are grateful for.



I felt like Jonas and I were just starting to get to a point where we had established new routines, finding joy in the new and learning new ways to cope. We’re now starting from square one again, even if just for a little while. We may not have the grocery store or the beach right now, but we have each other. And in the end, that’s what’s most important.
