After Brian died, I received many messages, cards, calls, texts, and letters from so many people in our lives to share their condolences, memories, and kind words about Brian.

Something that stuck out in all these messages was the amazing person that Brian was. I mean, I already knew this – I was married to him.

But it meant so much to me that others, even those who only knew him for a few months, got to really see and know the true Brian…and there was only one. Brian was always his true self, to all people. He was an open, kind soul, full of passion and curiosity, and I’m so touched that so many people saw this and shared their thoughts about Brian with me, as well.

So, on Brian’s birthday today, I want to share some of the messages that were sent to me and words that were said about Brian. This is Brian – a remarkable human being that brought so much joy and love to those around him. On this Pi Day, we honor him.

> “Brian was a hell of a guy. Without exaggeration, one of the smartest and thoughtful people I’ve ever worked with. One of the few people who can make their work truly their passion and strive to be an expert and expand his knowledge no matter what the subject. Such a rare mix of compassion, intelligence, and clarity. He will remain in my eyes as someone to strive to emulate even after he’s gone.”

“I loved every single interaction I had with Brian. His jovial spirit, his wit, his love of music … His dedication to exceptional work and the care he put into everything he did. In the brief time I worked with Brian I was exposed to so much goodness.”

He not only commits to doing his work on time and with excellence, he had a good attitude and always solved problems that arise without seeing “no solution” as an answer. He was so FUN to work with. I cannot tell you the number of “Dad” jokes there are in our DM. I think he just wanted everyone around him to be smiling as much as he was. He always talked about how proud of his wife he was. His son was his priority and you could tell the sheer JOY he had for being a dad.”

He loved being a dad and talked so highly of his wife, you could just tell how much he loved her and was so proud of her.”

“I could immediately tell Brian was a humble guy who made everyone feel comfortable, like they’ve known him forever.”

“He was a delight. He was intelligent, quick to find a solution and always thinking about what the end goal was. He was passionate for his family. It was clear he was motivated to give his best to his family and that motivation seeped into everything else he touched too.”

“He was so genuine and kind.”

“His charisma was so uplifting. The way he talked about his passions, namely his family, was so warm.”

“I was blown away by his knowledge, helpfulness, and consistent positive attitude. I left every conversation with a sense of accomplishment and something new learned.

“Brian Chatman was one of the best, most intelligent, and incredibly thoughtful humans in this world. I cry tears of loss and also joy that his spirit lives on in Jonas. Jonas will bring wonder, creativity, compassion, and quite a bit of laughter to this world.”

“Brian was one of maybe five people I’d share secret projects with. I could talk to him about anything, including religion, politics, and Rush. He was an amazing writer, thinker, guitarist, and friend. I’m going to miss him very, very much.”

“We'll miss you, Brian. Your impeccably timed dad jokes, your quiet thoughtfulness, and your kind spirit. You were a true friend.”
