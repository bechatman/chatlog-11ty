It’s Thursday, March 29, 2018. At 6:30 a.m. Brian awoke to a loud sound. “Ahh! Ahh! What’s going on? Is that the fire alarm?!”

“I’m pregnant! I’m pregnant, Brian! It’s positive! Do you see a line? There’s a line, right?” I screamed through excited tears. Brian struggled to sit upright in bed, blinking his eyes to try to see.

This was the moment Brian found out that he was going to be a dad.

We decided we couldn’t keep the news to ourselves, so we called our parents the next day to tell them they were going to be grandparents. We were just so excited from the moment that pink line first appeared.

Over the next nine months, Brian and I relished my growing belly and the kicks that began inside, growing stronger every day. One of Brian’s favorite things to do while I was pregnant was to lay his head on my belly, wanting the baby to kick him in the head. Brian said that when his mom was pregnant with his brother, Bradley, he would lay his head on his mom’s belly, and Bradley would give him a nice big kick in the head. Brian wanted his son to do the same to him – already looking forward to the rough-housing.

Brian was a natural at being a father. (Heck, he was telling “dad jokes” long before he was ever a dad!) But like most new fathers, he was nervous about his new role. He just wanted to make sure he didn’t do anything wrong. Brian wanted the best for his son, to make sure that he was healthy and happy, and he started doing everything he could to make that happen beginning that early morning in March 2018.

He and I did everything together throughout the pregnancy, and that was how we planned to parent together – as a team. Brian was front and center from the very beginning. He came to every single one of my prenatal appointments, never missing a single one.

He also changed most of Jonas’ diapers at first. I couldn’t walk due to the epidural, so Brian was on diaper duty for those first few days, and he quickly became a pro. I was incredibly impressed…so impressed that I was worried I would be inadequate at the job. So Brian taught me how to do it.

It was Brian that got me through those early days. He was amazing.

At this point, everything was now for Jonas. His safety was our top priority. So much so, that Brian even stopped getting off the highway at our normal exit, because he thought it was too dangerous with Jonas in the car due the blind curve. Instead, we would take the exit before ours for the remainder of our time in that apartment.

Brian found innovative ways to parent. He found a new changing pad that prevents Jonas’ arms from being able to reach down to interfere and has little toys to distract him. As usual, he was always on the lookout for “parenting hacks” or clever ways to do things better.

Brian had a magic touch. There were many nights that I just couldn’t get Jonas to sleep because I couldn’t seem to him calm down. Brian would go into his room and stroke his head, ever so gently from his temple to his hairline, and Jonas would fall fast asleep. He just needed Daddy’s touch.

Brian was always there for us every single day. At the end of each day, he would greet Jonas and me at the car when we arrived home. He’d open Jonas’ car door and say in a really goofy, playful voice, “Is there a baby in here? Hello baby!”. Or sometimes when he’d meet us at the door, he’d say, “Hello, family!” He was always there to greet us. We were his whole world, and he was ours.

Happy Father’s Day to the best dad I’ll ever know. Our son is the luckiest guy in the whole world to be able to call you Dad.
