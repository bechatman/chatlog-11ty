Sometimes you don’t know what you’re capable of until you’re forced into it.

When Brian died, I was terrified. At first, I was terrified to be alone for mere minutes; eventually it grew to hours, then weeks. Just before the pandemic hit in March, I thought I could get through this – grief, single-parenting, and navigating a new job in a new city with no support system nearby.

After all, I had a plan. I would have a family member or friend visit and help us about once a month. I was planning to live my life one month at a time, waiting for the next sigh of relief – the next round of support.

But 2020 has turned out to be one of the worst years ever, and it had other plans for me – me and the rest of the world.

One after another, trips got cancelled. It soon became clear that I could not expect help anytime soon. I’d been forced into weathering this global crisis by myself, with no end in sight for the near future. I think grappling with the unknown has been the worst part. That, and the inability to plan – or hope – because I had no idea when I would see my family or friends again.

I needed help in July. Brian’s parents knew they’d be entering a hot spot and didn’t want to risk flying and exposing themselves to others, and potentially contracting the virus. They drove over 19 hours in one shot to get to me and Jonas for a short visit.

Just before they arrived, I began to feel a huge sigh of relief. I had help coming. I had people I love coming to be with us. I did the math and realized that Jonas and I had made it five months without any visitors, and without any outside help.

The mere thought of that made me incredibly sad, but it also made me feel proud of this accomplishment – an accomplishment that I could never have foreseen doing, only a few short months ago. If I can get through five months juggling work, life as a single parent, AND a global pandemic – all while grieving the loss of Brian - then I can do anything. More importantly, this accomplishment showed me how much I’ve grown and the strength that I’ve developed in the past 7.5 months since Brian died.

I think back to those first days when I was terrified to bathe Jonas by myself, or to get gas in the car with him by myself, or to go to the grocery store with him by myself. I know those things seem so simple and trivial, but Brian and I had either always done those things together, or one of us would be at home with Jonas while the other went out to run our errands. Just doing life alone with Jonas was an incredible challenge at first. I look at all that I do now, all by myself, and think how proud Brian would be of me – how proud I am of myself.

It’s still incredibly hard. A day doesn’t go by without tears. But I do it. I just keep going, because I have to.

A week after Brian’s parents left, I lucked out. One of my best friends and her husband, who had been isolating at home, had the opportunity to drive down to us for a visit, and it was amazing!!! We played board games, made pizza, and just had a great time in each other’s company. It felt so good to do something normal for a change.

I can’t wait for life to go back to normal…whatever that may mean.

This pandemic has interfered with my ability to grieve and to move forward. I feel like my grief has been put on pause – or at least, in slow motion.

I will not be able to travel back home to Texas until there is a safe and effective vaccine, due to the risk I would cause to my high-risk family members. I hold out hope for a vaccine in January (as some early reports are saying), but I’m not holding my breath.

It’s likely that more than a year will go by before I can see my parents in person again, before I can hug them again.

It’s just as likely that more than a year will go by before I can visit Brian’s grave again – over a year after his funeral. I have not yet been able to visit and see his headstone in person. I had Brian’s parents FaceTime from his graveside so I could visit in the best way that I could, and some of our friends have visited his graveside and taken pictures, sending them to me so that I can see him.

This pandemic has prevented me from grieving in the way that I wish I could. It has made me angry. It has made me resentful.

But it has made me strong.

If I can get through this, I can do anything.

Even though I don’t know when then next trip will be, I look forward to going home. I look forward to watching Jonas running through my parents’ backyard, laughing and chasing the dogs. I look forward to sitting on the front porch swings, drinking coffee or wine and just chatting. I look forward to enjoying a fire in the backyard fireplace while gently rocking in the rocking chairs.

But most of all, I look forward to sitting beneath the branches of the majestic magnolia tree that shades Brian’s grave. I look forward to the day when I can visit him again.

I look forward to when life takes its finger off the pause button and allows all of us to move forward.
