  From overhyped bands finally meeting expectations to new bands that I finally
  found a way into, 2011 was a solid year for music.

If 2012 is the end of the world, 2011 wasn’t a terrible penultimate year.

In contrast to 2010 — which, except for TCU Football, ended up being one of the most stressful years I’ve ever been through — 2011 seemed to put things back on the right track and actually made me look forward to 2012, uncertainty and all.

Appropriately, putting together this year’s top albums list was easier as well.

Bands that have been hyped for years and fallen flat put out a steady stream of releases that set new standards or at least matched their previous efforts. Other groups I simply never gave a chance put out solid releases that made me take notice.

So, here it is, the best of 2011:

## 10. The Black Keys, “El Camino”

Coming out late in 2011, this one bumped Blitzen Trapper’s “American Goldwing” from my list for two reasons: It does the same job better, and it made me actually appreciate The Black Keys. The album offers a perfectly sized set of Blues Rock that appeals to almost anyone who grew up on a steady diet of 70s classic rock. The Black Keys have long been a band I knew I should like, but never did; “El Camino” made their sound more accessible and made me appreciate their back catalog as well.

## 9. Fair To Midland, “Arrows & Anchors”

This is an odd edition to the list given how let down I was by it. FTM’s last release, “Fables from a Mayfly,” came out in 2007, so a four-year gap should have produced an amazing album. The result equals their previous effort and progresses the band’s sound, but it doesn’t sound like four years of work. Is it worth your time? For metal/prog rock fans, definitely. Can they do better? Yes. Here’s hoping the next album has a shorter turnaround.

## 8. Trivium, “In Waves”

This will go down as 2011’s best album with the worst marketing. The standard album is 53 minutes of great heavy metal (with a touch too much screaming). Trivium manages to marry some of their “Ascendancy” era classic metal approach with the newer styles introduced on 2008’s “Shogun” to deliver another (belated) great album. The things I hate: The extra 20 minutes of mediocre songs breaking up the __real__ album flow dubbed a special edition version; the digital download pre-order that was available 15 hours __after__ iTunes availability; and the 256 kbps MP3 download (most bands sell 320 only, and many offer lossless FLAC versions).

## 7. Maritime, “Human Hearts”

How this band didn’t hit big like Phoenix (the nearest approximation of their sound I have), I don’t know. Their 2006 album “We, The Vehicles” should have a been a summer hit. No one (including me) noticed 2009’s wonderful “Heresy & The Hotel Choir.” Apart from placements in television shows and The Onion A.V. Club’s covers series intro, “Human Hearts” has gone largely unnoticed as well. What people are missing: Clever lyrics with catchy hooks and infectious songs that are fun and energetic.

## 6. Wilco, “The Whole Love”

Wilco is another band I knew I should like, but didn’t have an entry point. As if in response, Wilco delivered a greatest hits album with all new songs. Once you have the band’s entire back catalog (which I do now), you can pick out where each song on “The Whole Love” pulls from. While this is a negative for some, it is exactly what I needed to finally come around on Wilco. This album also started my obsession with 24-bit audio by becoming my first purchase from HDTracks.com.  

## 5. Foo Fighters, “Wasting Light”

Grohl and company have been letting me down for a while. Nirvana was my middle school soundtrack, so I give Dave a lot of slack. I stuck with him when he played drums as P. Diddy butchered Led Zeppelin’s “Kashmir,” and I tolerated “Nothing Left To Lose” and “One By One” as he turned The Foo into Wings (redux). I lost hope upon hearing his “return to rock” with “Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace.” All he needed, it turns out, was some time with John Paul Jones and Josh Homme. “Wasting Light” marries some Them Crooked Vultures with the classic Foo sound to deliver an album that can stand up next their eponymous debut and 1997’s “The Colour and the Shape.”

## 4. Telekinesis, “12 Desperate Straight Lines”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Telekinesis" data-album="12 Desperate Straight Lines"></div>

I hadn’t heard of Telekinesis when I went to see them with Portugal. The Man at Granada — I actually hadn’t heard much of Portugal to be honest. The concert sold me on both groups. The three-piece, minimalist rockers Telekinesis have a huge stage presence, and their music is a perfect throw-back to 60s-era pop in the tradition of early alternative/indie in the 80s.They aren’t breaking new ground, but I find myself going back to this album at least every week or so.

## 3. Portugal. The Man, “In the Mountain, In the Cloud”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Portugal. The Man" data-album="In the Mountain, In the Cloud"></div>

I’ve had 2009’s “The Satanic Satanist and the Majestic Majesty” and 2010’s “American Ghetto” in my library for a while and enjoyed them, but seeing Portugal live drove home how amazing (and prolific) they really are. You’d think a grueling tour schedule and annual album releases would degrade a band’s quality, but “In The Mountain, In the Cloud” continues the bands growth. The band pulls together atmospheric electronic, R&B, progressive rock, a touch for 60s/70s acid rock and a hippie aesthetic to give us something wholly new but very familiar. Also, this is the perfect album to listen to late at night with headphones and a turntable.

## 2. Rise Against, “Endgame”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="Rise Against" data-album="Endgame"></div>

In my book, every Rise Against album since 2004’s “Siren Song of the Counter Culture” has been great. That said, “Endgame” rises above them all. The first track/single “Architects” gave me goosebumps when I heard it and still can months later. Just that could warrant a mention on the list, but almost every song on the album rises to near the same level. The album hits at the heart of the late-20s demographic; we’re still young but our jobs/families/lives are slowly tempering the passion we had in high school and college. “Endgame” is an anthem for the quarterlife crisis — for those of us who know we are turning into our parents, just like we watched our parents turn into our grandparents before that. “Do you remember when you were young and wanted to set the world on fire? Well I still am, and I still do.”

## 1. The Decemberists, “The King Is Dead”

<div class="album albumArt" data-artist="The Decemberists" data-album="The King Is Dead"></div>

I spent a lot of time hating The Decemberists in college; damned if I remember why. To steal a phrase from Ted Leo, the band’s Celtic Emo sound hooked me in 2006 After drifting a bit too far into progressive rock with 2009’s “The Hazards of Love,” it seemed their entire fan base was ready to see them get back to basics. Early in 2011, I was immersing myself in R.E.M.’s early catalog (my latest obsession), then The Decemberists released a great R.E.M. album. “The King Is Dead” turned back the clocks to a sound more like frontman Colin Meloy’s previous group, Tarkio, and even brought in R.E.M. guitarist and indie legend Peter Buck to play on some tracks. All The Decemberists elements are still there — the hyper-literate lyrics, the anachronistic themes — but the album is bigger than that. It is the culmination of 30 years of a specific strain of indie rock tradition and was the right album at the right time. I’m not saying this album ended the current incarnation of R.E.M. and forced the breakup, but “The King is Dead” clearly represents a passing of the torch.
