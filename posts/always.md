One year ago, I stood before family and friends and spoke the hardest words that have ever come out of my mouth – my eulogy for Brian. The first few sentences were probably inaudible to most of those standing in the cold, on that winter day, two days before Christmas. Rows and rows of people stood in the Beth-EI section of Greenwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Fort Worth to say their last goodbyes to Brian.

I couldn’t make it through the first paragraph without reading through sobbing, gut-wrenching tears. But after the first few sentences, I pulled it together. I found the strength to read the rest of the eulogy more clearly. I wanted to honor Brian and make sure that everyone heard every last word of my goodbye to him and the words that spoke of his memory and his spirit.

It still seems like an alternate universe, having to bury your love at the age of 35. Brian was truly a unique human being. They’re not made like him. He was special. I always described Brian as a kind, gentle spirit. His passion, his intellect, his humor, his talent, his love is what defined him.

It’s been exactly one year since Brian died. Today is a day to remember him – to honor him. I’d like to share an excerpt from his eulogy that I wrote for him. It describes how I remember Brian – how I grieve and mourn Brian.

>  “I always loved what Brian told me about a Jewish belief - the belief that a person will always be alive as long as someone remembers them. They are alive in their memories. That is heaven to me. I know that is heaven to Brian. Brian is in heaven, alive in each of our memories. And because of that he will always continue to live on. So when Jonas asks me when he’s older where Daddy is, I can tell him that he is in heaven - alive in you, alive in me, alive in all those he loved.”

“Remember me, and I will always be with you”. These are the words carved into the polished black granite at Brian’s grave.

He will always be with us. 

The past is still a present somewhere. Somewhere we are together, laughing, and holding each other once again.
